Welcome to the In Voga channel! 
Every morning I open my eyes in Milan - the world capital of fashion 😍 I smile and start my day thinking what a wonderful place I live in
Every day when I have a cup of aromatic Italian coffee, I read fashion news
Every day I listen to the best fashion podcasts on the way to work and then plunge headlong into my favorite profession of a stylist
Every day I learn something new and exciting! 
Some time ago, I realized that most of all -  I WANT TO SHARE with the world everything I know - this is how my Telegram channel In Voga appeared! 
If you are interested in the world of fashion and you want to know what I know about it - I invite you to my world! 
Here we talk about fashion, follow its news, discuss current trends, and implement them into our real-life with ease and get absolute pleasure from it! 😍 Welcome! 
Oh, I've forgotten to introduce myself - my name is Natalia, and I'm an Italian fashion stylist
Nice to meet you!🤗
It seems that spring has begun everywhere, and the time to change shoes has finally arrived - we are discussing all the trendy shoes for spring 2021
Let's start with the 🥿ballerina shoes, which in 2021 have their own characteristics compared to the classic pair popularized by Chanel last century.
So, modern ballet flats have the following features:
✔️NO🙅🏼‍♀️ structure, only soft shapes
The structure on ballerina shoes is so absent that they can be easily turned into mules and worn without a backdrop - this pleases - variety and comfort! 👍🏼
✔️Fully closed
In some versions, ballet flats are not even very similar to ballet flats😝 but rather resemble boots.
✔️Absolutely flat sole
✔️Minimalistic decor
First of all, we avoid bright decor, but it is better to exclude any.
✔️Ideally, the shape of the cutout on ballerinas should follow the contour of the shoes' toed
An ideal👌🏼 example of everything we talked about above can be Mango ballet flats
By the way, there you can almost always find affordable options for trendy shoes, and the quality is very pleasing.
Here are some options:
🧷 Medium Brown square toes ballerinas -  
🧷 Black square toes ballerinas -  
🧷 Brown square toes ballerinas - 
🧷 Wine long toes ballerinas -
I really like the saturated colors of both options - ideal for spring days👌🏼
And some "ballet" street style for inspiration
And we are again about the topic of sustainability  - H&M also continues to walk along its "greenway"🌱,  and the guide to this ECO-kingdom in 2021 will be none other than Aria Stark, well, in the sense of Maisie Williams.
The goal🎯 is set - by 2030, H&M will use only recycled or ECO-friendly materials.
Maisie has already posted a video on Instagram where she turns into an avatar and becomes a digital heroine who protects the environment.
The video is inspiring👌🏼 - I liked it, the goal is also good, and the main character impresses me as a whole
Still, the main thing is that it becomes a reality, not a fabulous H & M marketing road.🤞🏼
The way of sustainability 🌱 is a whole direction of the modern fashion industry, so Gabriela Hirst, in her Fall 2021 collection for Chloe, emphasized environmental friendliness, saying that when creating the latest collection, Chloe reduced the environmental impact by 400%☝🏼 compared to last winter.
Interestingly, the Chloe team found about 50 vintage Chloe items on eBay by creating a collection, bought them, and used them to create new bags👜 Today, I finally looked at those very eco-friendly🌍 handbags in detail, sharing with you.
We take an example, remember hand-made skills, and use ideas.💡
Today we have another shoe trend 2021 - however, the option is not for the faint of heart 😂 2020 has presented us with a new trend, which is at its peak in the spring of 2021 - Slippers!
In the spring version, these are primarily fur slippers
For those looking to give it a try, I recommend considering the following options:
❗️Important advice when selecting "street slippers" - pay attention to the thickness of the sole
It is recommended to be quite dense and massive for use outside the house.
# shoes2021
It turned out to be not so easy to find something from street fur slippers in the middle price segment🤷🏼‍♀️ Basically -  luxury, which is too expensive for a fast enough💨, in my opinion, trend
But there are still 2✌🏼 excellent and economical options😉
🧷brown by Mango -  (in cold weather, we style with socks🧦)
🧷very cute😍 by H&M:
cream- 
The sole of everyone is relatively high - you can walk on the street, but, of course, they are suitable for the house, so you can experiment, but if it doesn’t work, we can use it to home😉
And by tradition  "slipper's street style" for inspiration
And today we have an unexpected topic - we are discussing wedding dresses👰🏼, which have long ago destroyed all boundaries and stereotypes and do not obey any🙅🏼‍♀️ framework.The last year with its own "special rules" only accelerated this trend.
It gave additional freedom🤘🏼 of choice to brides all over the world
Changing veils and crenaline for more casual and comfortable options, today it is not at all necessary to choose a wedding dress among bridal collections, and for inspiration, I propose to consider the Fall collections 2021 2022 favorite designers in search of the very same😍
I like these alternatives, do you? 😉
A little more about spring shoes, today we are talking about the most basic, which has long won the hearts of everyone and does not plan to give up the palm
This leadership works regardless of gender - WHITE SNEAKERS.
Interesting facts 👇🏼
✔️  Our favorite "ugly shoes" (or, on the contrary, hated for someone) seem to be losing ground and moving into the category of outgoing trends
They are being replaced by smooth rounded shapes of sneakers, which resemble bowling shoes.
✔️ sneakers have not bypassed the trend of sustainability 🌱 They are made of plastic and not only😉
# shoes2021
Double dressing of celebrity millennials - getting inspired 😉
Can't start today with anything but Oscar! Los Angeles shimmered uniquely tonight✨
First, despite the fears of the online Oscar 2021, it was predominantly held with a personal presence, which means we could fully enjoy the outfits
I share the best:
In my opinion, the first one who distinguished himself is Valentino, whose couture dresses just filled the red carpet:
"Red on the red" - well, where without this phenomenon! Amanda Seyfried in a dizzying neckline pleated by Armani Privé and Angela Bassett in an Alberta Ferretti column dress with puff sleeves and an imposing slit, Olivia Colman continues to play the queen in a Dior dress.
Clean and strict lines and minimalism also couldn't do without - Vanessa Kirby with pale pink from Gucci, consisted of a bustier, a skirt, and a train, of course.
Celeste Waite was remembered by everyone's favorite Gucci handbag, and Regina King shone with crystals on blue from Louis Vuitton.
Laura Dern played the black and white swan Oscar de la Renta, and Halle Berry enjoyed infantilism with Dolce & Gabbana - pink folds and a giant bow, Maria Bakalova appeared almost like a Disney princess in a dress with a tulle skirt from Louis Vuitton.
In general, as always, there is something to see and besides the films for which everyone has gathered! 😝
When it comes to footwear for Spring-Summer 2021, I just can't get around the "Merry Jane" straps - a trend that is relevant for ballet flats and shoes.
In general, we just copy the classic silhouette of the early 20th century Merry Jane shoes
Only modern models are still mostly WITHOUT🙅🏼‍♀️ heels
However, "a-la vintage" models with small heels will undoubtedly decorate your wardrobe...
The inviolability of white sneakers👟 in our wardrobes has not been challenged for a long time, a couple of days ago, And as their "beloved couple" 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩 this season, we continue to choose skirts, and there is a place for everyone: ✔️mini✔️midi✔️maxi
Inspired by a selection from Spring 2021 shows and collections - Dolce & Gabbana, Celine, Alexander McQueen, Thom Browne, Marni, Yohji Yamamoto, Tod's
COS- is my passion😍 because here you can find awesome conceptual and modern things and shoes, today we are admiring perfect leather ballet flats with a pointed toe - 
They correspond to all the features of modern ballet shoes,  If you need essential high-quality shoes for a long time, I recommend COS, they have never let me down👍🏼
"Pink mania" doesn't seem to bypass anyone this summer😂 And even for those who prefer NOT to see our life in pink, there are options👌🏼
Let's see how different it is, this pink💗
💖total pink in cheeky shades gives us Barbie style
💗🖤 pink with contrasting black - rock motives
💕 soft pink with white and flesh - innocence itself
What is your choice? 😉
As soon as the sidewalks dry up and the rains end, we remember☝🏼 that the pants in 2021 should be as long as possible!😍
For example, these mustard-colored linen pants -  
Perfect composition and silhouette for the summer!👌🏼 Straight silhouette and graceful cuts👍🏼 I took for myself precisely the same from Massimo Dutti in lilac, only their price was not so pleasant.
And if you want to put together a set, then a cool linen bomber jacket in the same mustard color will help you -  Which, however, can be mixed with almost any jeans, shorts, and even dresses.
What a stylish👌🏼 "grandfather's" khaki vest appeared in Mango - 
And several ideas for styling a voluminous vest with pockets at once.
It is good not only with trousers and jeans, in combination with a dress or skirt, but the image will also be even more complete
🤩 Well, of course, it could not have done without voluminous sleeves
By the way, in the interpretation of Mango with a small flower, it looks like a 5 plus!
And in continuation of the "aesthetics of pockets," I share my favorite collection Fendi Spring 2019.💔 It is already a couple of years old, but it never ceases to be relevant and beautiful.
Leather, fur, silk, perforated, denim,  various sizes and shapes - I'm all about pockets😝 Hypertrophied functionality has turned into a whole direction.
Get inspired!
And for those who are inspired, one more correct👍🏼 vest in three colors from H&M at an enjoyable price - 
I began to prepare my wardrobe for the summer and realized that I catastrophically lacked basic crop-tops, and without them this summer, we're definitely nowhere🤷🏼‍♀️
For me, a basic crop top is:
✔️ simple silhouette,
✔️ without decor,
✔️ neutral colors,
✔️ thick enough material to be worn "without everything,"
✔️but at the same time, they should have "guides" to avoid the effect of a flattened chest🙅🏼‍♀️ (almost an intimate detail, but very important when choosing, so I could not help but note it)
If you see such - take without hesitation in several colors because it is not easy to find them
Still, you will use them everywhere! I suppose there will be dissenting people who "never wear crop tops anywhere, and cannot imagine themselves wearing them!"
There are such, right?😉 Next, we will discuss 1000 and one way to wear crop tops - you will definitely not remain indifferent! 😉
And now the promised ways to style the crop top, 💯0 and 1 piece:
📌classic - with a trouser suit: lowers the degree of officialdom and transfers from the category "for the office" to "fashion".
📌 sport chic - with cycle shorts/leggings under an oversized blazer
📌 pure casual - with jeans under a jacket
📌 femininity itself - with pants/skirt at the high waist
📌cute, very cute - with trousers/jeans under a knitted cardigan
📌 for the most daring - with a mini
📌modern romance - with a midi skirt under a jacket
📌comfort - under an oversized shirt (the shirt can be unbuttoned, buttoned asymmetrically, left half-open at the bottom or top)
📌creative - over a shirt or blouse
Visual for each of the options above⬆️ - make your choice👌🏼
Today I will start to tell you about all the JEWELRY trends for the coming summer! 😉
And we will start with that same MINIMALISM.
Laconicism is the basis for basic jewelry for the ages
The minimalism of jewelry is, first of all - no engraving, no gems, simple shapes
This jewelry is easiest to fit into any wardrobe, and it is they that seldom allow you to make a mistake with the choice.
This will balance the overall image.
We continue the theme of JEWELRY 2021, and let's see who is stepping on the heels of minimalism this year?
Antique jewelry
Antique motifs are expressed in large jewelry
The primary materials for such jewelry are natural, those that our ancestors could find for making jewelry (gold, silver, copper, clay, wood, etc.).
Such jewelry looks as if not perfect, incomplete, rough, found during excavations, which creates the effect of having a rich history and belonging to a particular culture.
Ask anyone - which bag is the symbol of Chanel?
And you will definitely get the only correct answer - Chanel 11.12
Even if you didn't know the name of this model, then you definitely imagine a black quilted handbag with an interwoven leather chain and a double C with a lock, right?
Last week, Chanel talked about how the legendary bag is created in its - leather selection, quilting, logo attachment, and, of course, the weaving of a leather strap and chain
This is how the legendary and one of the most famous bags in the world is born! 👜
Take a moment and enjoy the process😉 - 
On the eve of summer, I propose to start discussing dresses, and today we have a battle of the titans🤜
Knitted VS Silk dress
I have a personal leader identified over the years, but I will try to be impartial
Knitted dress
✅Practically wrinkle-free
✅ Pleasant to the body (although this is subjective)
✅ Incredibly feminine like a second skin, especially in nude  shades
❌But at the same time, you need to be prepared that it will quickly highlight the shortcomings🤷🏼‍♀️
❌It is not very easy to combine with other things and requires attention on this issue
Silk dress
✅The most easily stylized dress in the world
It mixes with almost everything - you can put on a jacket, shirt, sweater or cardigan, trench coat, and it would be great to add a turtleneck, a basic T-shirt, etc., under the dress
The shoes are the same -  there are no frames 👌🏼
✅ Very femininity too
❌ "Collects" stains in no time
Well, in conclusion - both continue to be relevant in 2021, so whatever choice you make, it is still ✅ correct!
Hermes Kelly pic-nic is available, alas, not to everyone! But Mango doesn't  allow us to worry about this for a long time😂 -  
A miniature rattan handbag inspired by the "heavy luxury" pleases both the eye and the wallet! 👌🏼
And don't hesitate to wear rattan bags in cooler weather, throw away the stereotypes that this is only a summer option! And the option with a trench coat is the best! 😍
To not be unfounded on wicker bags, I made a selection of street style from all over the world, but primarily French women.😉
Perfect is rattan baskets and bags with a casual style - jeans, shorts, sandals, they fit well into the classics - trench coats, jackets, trousers.
How to choose a bag - basket? 🤔
There are countless wicker bags after the 2020 boom
If you want to achieve the above effect, give preference to the following:
✅ keep their shape,
✅ natural or as close as possible to the material and prominent weave
✅ neutral natural shades
❌ lack or minimal amount of decor.
I recommend everyone to think about a French basket, and DO NOT wait for summer, it is beautiful in spring!
Hello everyone!
Today we have a mini fashion quiz😉
This color pair 2021 is spoken about at every "fashionable corner," its fans are celebrities and the most famous fashion bloggers
It gives an incredibly positive and leaves no one indifferent!
What is this combination? 😉
And while we are preparing for the summer, the world of fashion is already one step ahead
Every day we see more and more new fall-winter 2021 collections
Let's talk about Saint Laurent today.
We continue to live in a world of limitations, so the collection was filmed online, but this time I didn't regret it a single gram! 🤩
Events unfold in perhaps one of the most epic and alluring, but at the same time frightening and repulsive places on our planet - Iceland
Incredible landscapes, sheer cliffs, and a raging sea, ice floes drifting on the blue surface and chaotically scattered over the dark volcanic sand.
"Freedom, sometimes wild and hostile, but FREEDOM!" - the message of the creative director Anthony Vaccarello.
The collection combines the rock aesthetics of the 90s, the silhouettes of the 60s, and the vibrancy of the 80s.
A special place among all this splendor was taken by jewelry - flashy, shiny, and leaving no chance to miss them! Chains, gems, chokers, elongated pendants, chain belts, layering, and combinations break any stereotypes
Well, the picture was completed by the symbolically pointed metal toe of shoes and knee-high boots, so long that their top was hidden even under the mini😝
Take a few minutes and recharge with the energy of freedom - 
And now about the most unusual and catchy pairs from the Saint Laurent collection.😉 Let's get used to them, we will wear them in the coming autumn.😝
✔️ "Granny" vest and mini skirt from the 80s
Retro + disco, I never tire of repeating about the power of the 💪🏼 combination of incongruous.
✔️ We mix jewelry indiscriminately
Gold, silver, large colored gems- everything is mixed.😂
✔️Spandex + tweed
 Another shocking 😳 couple
The bourgeois style of tweed is muted by the gloss of lycra.👌🏼
✔️ECO-fur with lamé
Previously, only rock stars looked like this, now we are trying too! 😉
✔️ Sequins and denim
This is an ideal way to integrate your festive sequin top or skirt into everyday life
 I have been using it for a long time, and every time I enjoy the attention and comfort!👌🏼
A couple of days ago, we voted for the best color pair of summer 2021 and.....Bravi! 👏🏼 You are absolutely right!
Green + pink = the perfect couple👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩 for spring and summer 2021!
In the meantime, let's get inspired!
Today we will talk about headscarves and bandanas (call them whatever you like, I use all these concepts in the broadest possible sense), more precisely, about the methods of their actual stylization this spring and summer! You wrote to me the question: "How can you wear them correctly?"
I am happy to share😉
Let's start with the types
I would single out 2✌🏼 main types that are most relevant this year:
Classic silk scarves, mostly with geometric or abstract prints.
Monochromatic headscarves made of natural materials (linen, cotton, and their analogs) - the maximum closeness to nature, the most natural colors.
And now to the fun part - HOW TO TIE a headscarf?
In short - the simpler, the better, complex designs of scarves on the head are in the past, well, at least for now, and we give preference to simple solutions
Well, it's easier for us.
Method 1
We remove the hair, tie the ends at the back (on or under the hair), and you're done.
And here, it would be appropriate to recall especially relevant in the 2021st way to tie a scarf from Rihanna - the tips should stick out in different sides.
By the way, the "babushka style" men in 2021 also did not pass by😉
And we don't forget about the jewelry, which we began to discuss last week, today we have ETHNICA and BOHO style
✔️ various materials,
✔️ fringe,
✔️ unusual textures,
✔️ natural fabrics,
✔️ ethnic motives,
✔️ aged look and
✔️ layering
👆🏼 These are the main features that can be used to characterize the ethnic style.
The leading representative of this direction is the elongated pendants, and we will talk about them in detail.
Long necklaces and sautoirs can be a perfect way to stretch your silhouette and draw attention to your upper body
If you want to visually narrow your shoulders and lengthen your neck - a long necklace works 100%
Still, if you complement it with a V-neck, the effect will be amazing! 🤩
How do we style?
For a long necklace to look modern, it is best to avoid🙅🏼‍♀️ styling it with monochrome silhouette turtlenecks, T-shirts, or blouses.
A correct✅ way of stylization was offered to us by Dior and Chanel at their summer shows - a long pendant + a rather formal outfit: over a shirt, tie, with a classic jacket, etc.
We mix two opposite styles, and we get a deep and relevant look in 2021👍🏼
One of the most coveted😍 bags for Spring / Summer 2021 is the Prada Re-Nylon bag
I'm sure you've heard, seen, and possibly wanted to?
Mass-market continues to be inspired by luxury😝 I found 3 delicate colors:
✔️ vanilla - 
✔️ light blue - 
✔️ pink - 
Plus to this:
✔️ black classic - 
✔️ trending green - 
What is the beauty of this nylon bag (apart from it is the IT bag of the coming summer)?
It is very light and weightless, it can be a very cool accent for any outfit for color blocking👌🏼 or fit into a minimalist's wardrobe.
And we are again about headscarves🧕
Eternal Method № 2, which we have seen many times at all times - we tie a scarf with a knot under the chin.
As a variety, you can pin a brooch on the ends of the scarf, it looks fresh and unusual.
If you want something more bohemian, just add a few details to the previous method - wrap the ends of the scarf around your neck and tie it at the back, and, of course, complement it with sunglasses.
We start the day with Chanel, just recently, we saw their Resort 2022
I can't say🤷🏼‍♀️ that I am wholly delighted with the collection itself, but in terms of jewelry - I was pleased 👌🏼
what we have already discussed in the topic of jewelry - minimalism - is not about Chanel😂 (and not at any time🙅🏼‍♀️)
Аntiquity - if there were slight echoes, then only slightly noticeable, but boho style and elongated pendants and sautoirs - it's right to the point!
We look, what we have for styling the latter:
✔️ mix with ties;
✔️ if on a turtleneck - then one more layer is required,
✔️ we use layering,
✔️ unique chic - on a naked body.
Go ahead - use ideas!
A few more notes📖 about Chanel Resort 2022:
✔️ Chains on the belt are back with us, and not only for rock stylization but also with tweed, velvet skirts, with feathers and fringes
If, nevertheless, associations in your head haunt you, then just choose not a chain in the total sense of the word but a pearl alternative.
✔️ A tie on a naked body - 👍🏼and in order not to overdo it with frankness, combine with a blazer.
✔️ Pearl collars are my new dream😍 , and frill is my pleasant little discovery.
✔️ White sports socks with mesh pantyhose are more of a catwalk option, but the combination made me smile anyway😊
Lace this year gains new strength, remaining in its charming form
And now, lace is not about seduction and sexuality🙅🏼‍♀️
Lace 2021 is authenticity, craft, and even "grandmother's" motives.
Choosing a type of especially relevant lace 2021:
✔️ knitted (for example, crochet)
✔️ nodular (as an example - familiar to all macrame)
✔️ wicker (wicker with bobbins and others)
Visualization, as usual, is attached.
Green inspiration 🌱🐍🦜🍀🌵🍏🥬🧩💚 from the brightest blogger in the western hemisphere, 
A girl in whose ribbon you can always get a charge of positiveness, energy, and skills in combining prints and working with color.
As we have already noted many times, Mango shoes beat all records in trend and relevance, and all this, coupled with an acceptable price💰 and decent quality👌🏼
My heart💔 pounded faster when I saw sandals inspired by the IT model of the coming summer from Khaite - 
Graceful, stylish, with "puffed" laces (these should not bite into the leg), will fit into hundreds of looks, but their best (even better than Khaite) is olive color
There is also a black option for those who love darker - 
It seems that next year I won't miss Eurovision, because it will be practically on the next street! 😂 I'm sure you've already heard about yesterday's victory 🥇 of the Italian group Måneskin!
Italy rejoices!🎉 And I couldn't stay away🤷🏼‍♀️
Well, since our channel is about fashion, let's talk on the topic
Without exaggeration, these are the most stylish participants in Eurovision 2021! Without fear of experimentation, they try everything - classic rock looks, gothic, hippies, prints, feathers literally..
see for yourself! 😍
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro!🤘🏼
Auguri, ragazzi!😘
Returning to scarves and kerchiefs, you sent me a question: "What about a scarf as a turban?"
Of course, I will not be entirely categorical
However, I will remind you that we are still in the era of minimalism and simple silhouettes, although the harbingers of brilliance already appear
So, we also try not to "build sandcastles" on our heads 🏰 than the simpler, the better.
Total👇🏼 Method number 3
We fold the scarf and tie it as a headband - this will be the perfect solution!
Yesterday, in my wardrobe, finally, there was a change of seasons
It began to play with bright colors🟡🟢🔵🟣🔴🟠 Going through (and remembering at the same time) my summer bags, I wondered, which model is my favorite? 🤔
And that evening, as ordered, an article soft maxi clutches caught my eye
And it dawned on me - here it is! ☝🏼 The ideal model of my summer!
In the last couple of years, everything was spoiled by Bottega's annoying dumpling
 No, I had nothing against him before he until he showed up everywhere😱 But if you step back and think, then the model of a frame clutch in maxi size is excellent😍
Frame clutch in MAXI size:
✔️Comfortable during the day and refined in the evening (without changing the horses, you can go to your favorite summer restaurant for dinner)
✔️The optimal size (not too large, because it is still a clutch, but not a mini-mini, in which there is nothing at all🤷🏼‍♀️)
✔️Perfect frame clasp - opens and closes with one hand while keeping all contents safe, even if the bag is dropped unexpectedly.
✔️Well, it continues to be actual 👌🏼 Not a single Bottega, many more alternatives appear every year.
We are again about the jewelry of the coming summer, and today we are discussing INFANTILISM 
The main features are pastel or, on the contrary, bright colors, "cheap" materials like plastic, flowers, and other delicate shapes, uncomplicated silhouettes.
In 2021, the most TOP jewelry in this direction is PLASTIC RINGS and the already familiar to us JEWELRY FROM BEADS.
See details👇🏼
Children's motifs👧🏼 seem to have peaked in popularity in the jewelry category, especially with rings.
Plastic rings are the easiest and most economical💰 way to add modern trends to your outfit this summer.
A particular solution can be a combination of plastic parts with gems - we combine the incompatible (as we thought before)
Of course, this is no longer so economical, but, in general, I really like it! 😍
And today some "real" jewelry from the Mango variety, I divided them down according to the current trends that we discussed.👇🏼
Antique and rustic styles - talked about them 🧷 Wide bracelet with stones - 
🧷 Spiral Earrings - 
🧷 Irregular shaped hoop earrings - 
🧷Embossed ring - 
🧷Necklace made of stones - 
🧷Earrings with irregular shaped pearl - 
Ethnic and boho - details 🧷Knitted necklace - 
🧷Wood necklace with coin pendant - 
🧷Knitted earrings - 
Oh, how many jokes (and not always funny🤷🏼‍♀️) we heard about Pantone's prediction for 2021 colors - Ultimate Gray and Illuminating 🤪
Of course, I didn't join the association for their protection
However, still, I want to note that yellow will not pass by this summer, especially for dresses.
Evidence above👆🏼 The range of names is impressive - Alberta Ferretti, Prada, Valentino, Miu Miu, Etro, Versace, Alexsander McQueen, Bottega Veneta, Erdem, Chloe, Giambattista Valli, Sportmax, Altuzarra, Blumarine, Twinset ..
Not green alone, as they say 👌🏼
Psychedelic by Fendi   - , the familiar logo is distorted, flipped, blurred, stretched, and compressed.
The magnet effect🧲 in the new limited-edition capsule Vertigo summer 2021 makes you watch without stopping
The capsule was created as part of a collaboration with the artist Sarah Coleman (by the way, she is in the photo - on the stairs).
And the star of the 🌟 FENDI Vertigo summer 2021 collection (literally and figuratively) was not the distorted logo, and not even Sarah Coleman, but the Peekaboo ISeeU bag with the FF logo with a special treatment that glows in the dark.
For many decades, everyone has been talking about the true French style
Over the years, there have been many stereotypes that are far from reality🤷🏼‍♀️
What is French aesthetics?🤔
Today I read , whom we have seen many times Caroline de Maigret (model, writer ), Léna Situations (fashion blogger), Joséphine de La Baume (actress, singer), Camille Charrière (influencer, writer), Omaima Salem (stylist).
So, they were all asked the same questions.👇🏼
What does beauty mean in French?
Opinions were divided - naturalness  without visible efforts VS beauty have no visual features, it is something that is not formulated and defies stereotypes.
Why is the phenomenon of the French girl so widespread in the world?
Everyone wants to wake up beautiful without effort, and the modern French style promotes just that
The reason for everything is the desire to be more natural, freer, to make a minimum of effort😝
What about makeup?
Here again, it is ambiguous - light natural makeup still wins a little
But 2020 has left its traces here, too - even classic French women want to experiment.
Well, let's draw conclusions.
The French style is free from stereotypes, more often natural, but if the heart demands it, it can be bright and shocking
The phenomenon of the attractiveness of French women is that they look the way they like.
Perhaps trite, but true! 🤷🏼‍♀️
How about discussing one of the most provocative accessories of the coming summer? Chains adorn our waist again! Do not rush to flip through with a thought: "Well, no, it's not mine!" 😂
Yes, of course, the first association that we all have is hello from the 90s because it was then that we saw a boom in this style
the 90s are not the only time when you used chains on your belt, and if you are not ready for such decisions, just look for inspiration sooner.
Even at the beginning of the 19th century, during the Empire period, dresses were decorated with chains, decorated with ribbons during the day, and in the evening performance were "served" with gems and pearl chains on the belt.
All this I mean is that trends can be interpreted in different ways! 😉 Experiment!
* The tapes of fashion influencers are already full of examples of stylization from the 90s, and if you choose a more elegant option, I recommend that you take inspiration from Chanel.
Today I read the news that Coco Chanel's apartment in Paris has been reopened after a severe restoration
It has become even a little more like an apartment from the times of the hostess's life and plunges into her world even more profound.
Once in Paris, quite a long time ago, I happened to look there, and for me, this excursion ended with a big question
Why does the interior of the apartment, which was so close and dear to the mistress, so strongly doesn't correspond to her sober approach to creating fashion?
Pomp, the theatricality of Art Deco in the interior
                      VS
Practicality and innovation in her fashion
Where to look for the truth? 🤔
If I manage to get to Paris this year, I will look into the museum again, perhaps the time has put some things on the shelves in my head, and I will answer my questions.
Have you been to Tuscany? Endless and endless fields of poppies, daisies, and sunflowers🌺🌸🌼🌻 - an incredible sight ..
No, don't worry, I haven't changed the theme of my channel to travel
I just want to tell you about Salvatore Ferragamo's new multimedia project - Tuscan Wildflowers.
Within the framework of the project, 6 artists from all over the world (France, Spain, Brazil, Korea, and, of course, Italy, or rather Florence) will glorify the print of Tuscan wildflowers.
Wildflowers do not obey the rules, they grow by themselves, this is the kind of chaos that lies at the heart of uniqueness!
As part of this project, we will see a limited collection that will be sold at the world-famous resorts - Capri, Forte Dei Marmi, Marbella, Cannes, Miami, Las Vegas, Hawaii, and Rio De Janeiro
And the most desirable element of the collection is predicted to be the Ferragamo Studio Bag
Every bag is unique for each of the resorts - the name of the resort is engraved on the shoulder strap of each bag.
For my taste, the bag claims to be a worthy competitor to the Dior book tote (although the novelty is suspiciously similar to the last one😂)
 Those who want to join the beautiful on the official Ferragamo website will be able to find a travel diary: illustrations, collages, photos and animations that convey a piece of the local Tuscan culture.
I recommend looking by👉🏼 and having a lot of pleasure!
We have not been surprised that there are no rules on the podium for a long time - for some, it is chaos, for some art
Today post for the second😂
We are talking about deconstructivism, which from year to year, and the collection from the collection is gaining momentum
Monse - the brand is only 5 years old, still, it has already shown itself to be a real "sower of fashion chaos" - this is me about deconstructivism.
The collection under the slogan "we need a smooth exit from the dark times of the pandemic" turned out to be not too flashy, wearable, and promising that "changing sweatpants and hoodies" can also be comfortable.
There are trendy overalls, cargo pants, mini skirts with maxi pockets, a drop of patchwork, an endless row of stripes, and even your own vision of a classic silk dress
👌🏼Well, it couldn't do without actual trends- dresses with an open back, tops with slits, laces - as a symbol returning 2000s.
Yesterday we discussed, that it would be time to leave the hoodies and joggers loved and look for alternatives
Today, there is an option for those who disagree - long hoodies and hoodies as dresses.
A baggy oversized silhouette is balanced with bare knees, and then we can develop 2 options:
☝🏼 Support the hoody/sweatshirt theme with sneakers
✌🏼 Go to sport chic and add heels (boots, shoes, sandals - depending on the season and for the most daring, even very high boots are suitable)
✔️If you are not ready for the length of the mini, add a skirt down - maxi or midi, preferably from light, even transparent material.
✔️To maintain balance and not overdo it with sports,, choose frame bags with a shape.
✔️Avoid🙅🏼‍♀️ tight sweatshirt dresses, this is a story from the past, it is not relevant now
We are talking about options "from a man's shoulder."
Let's talk about summer shoes? I don’t take any closed (ballet flats, loafers, sneakers, slip-ons ...), now about truly summer☀️ options👌🏼
"Grandfather's" sandals or fisherman's sandals
It is very modest, monochromatic, but very comfortable, absolutely asexual, out of gender- only the most fashionable ones have them! Oh, how desirable such sandals have become by everyone,  sold out🤷🏼‍♀️ everywhere.
The progenitor, or rather the main revivalist of those, was, of course, The Row, but the number of those "inspired" is off the charts, so you don't have to spend crazy money to buy a fashion trend.
Let's continue the topic of sandals and find out - How to choose fisherman sandals?
As simple as possible, we choose neutral primary colors (black, white, beige, well, as a last resort, brown or approximate), a complete lack of decor, a flat sole - not too thin, but not too overpriced, the straps intertwine, overlap and ideally covers almost the entire foot, including protecting the toes.
How do we styling the fisherman sandals?
We choose a reasonably elegant or classic company:
✔️Romantic dresses and skirts, light flying fabrics, voluminous silhouettes, flounces.
✔️Classic trousers will dilute the sandals and transform your image from pure boring classics into fashion.
✔️ Separately, I will note such a pair as socks - this is the best neighborhood for sandals, if, of course, you have the courage.😝
❌ Natural fur ❌REDValentino
It seems that fashion brands have ceased to follow the celebrity's "instructions blindly," Despite several outings in the mink of Riana, Cardi B, and Jennifer Lopez noticed last March the list of renowned brands that have abandoned the use of natural fur is growing.
Let me remind you that Prada, Gucci, Bottega Veneta Armani, Versace, Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo, DKNY, Burberry, Chanel, Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen, and now Valentino are in the 🌱"green party." Autumn collection 2021-2022 will be the last fur collection for Valentino.
And other news - the second line of the fashion house - REDValentino will be closed in 2024
I hope this was due to the desire to consume wisely.
And on this summer day, I propose to take into little fur memory from Valentino over the past decade.
Do you know why I love the effect of pleated fabrics? Predictable😂 Things like that never wrinkle!
I don't suffer the desire for perfect surfaces
However, after 20 minutes of driving, it's sometimes scary to look at my summer linen "palazzo," which, according to the plan, should have beautifully fallen while walking along the embankment.😂 So with a pleated effect of these problems does not exist.👌🏼
It seems that this summer, someone heard my thoughts even before I voiced them
And one of the most relevant textures will be the pleated  effect - dresses, skirts, trousers, and my favorite - suits.
Noble and feminine suits in light shades conquered my heart even in winter and early spring
In winter we wore knitted ones, but common sense and the understanding that these long light trousers would become at least gray a minute after leaving the house didn't allow me to have them buy
In the summer we can afford more! 😝
A great example  Mango👇🏼
And a drop of inspiration from global influencers.
How do we style?
✔️ We tuck the blouse into the trousers completely or asymmetrically
✔️Blouse over top / crop top / bra
✔️Blouse under a jacket
From footwear to everyday life, mixes of styles are close to me - with semi-sports, sandals, or even sneakers
However, advanced options with heels for the evening are also breathtaking.
Summer☀️ is a great time to experiment, including jeans.😉
✔️ We are experimenting with unusual cuts and holes that have finally returned to us!
✔️ Boldly change black, gray, and dark blue colors to light blue, white, or even color, and if it's boring for you, you can add a print
✔️Relatively "safe" from dirt, we allow ourselves trendy elongated options, well, you remember😉 , to directly sweep the floor😝
✔️ Hits of summer 2021 - patchwork in any form👌🏼 and cuts on the side or front.
Good morning or for someone already day! 😉
Today we will start the day with a vintage selection with white trousers - this is a continuation of the theme of Your white pants can be pajamas, flared, high waist, fringe, crochet, classic straight or relaxed chic, masculine or incredibly feminine.
We get inspired, and let's choose! 😉
I propose to continue talking about the shoes of the summer of 2021, and ..
I'm even afraid to write the next trend😂 If the  suddenly seemed rude to you
You simply did not see CLOGS - massive slippers of farmers and peasants with wooden soles, which appeared in the Middle Ages ...
Modern clogs are very diverse - from classic models to options with heels, the sole can also differ significantly
It was not always made of natural wood
However, the overall look and aesthetics are always close to the historical prototype.
Well, the most exciting thing ..
What can I wear them with (I'm talking about clogs if someone missed the previous post)?
Styling such shoes is not an easy task because they are always accentuated and very authentic.
✔️If you choose basic tones for your clogs, let's continue minimalism in clothing color and choose clear structural silhouettes - trousers, straight jeans, cotton shirts, and T-shirts
In this case, the emphasis will remain on the shoes due to their unusual shapes.
✔️If you are ready for bold decisions, you can experiment and combine colored clogs with summer sundresses and skirts, ruffles, and lace
In this case, clogs will give some of the attention and just become a worthy match for your summer outfit.
✔️Well, socks didn't pass by here
I commented on this many times
I just will say - it's POSSIBLE.
Summer is a time to experiment, a time to enjoy color and print! Today is a "polka dot" from the spring-summer 2021.
Let me remind you briefly that this summer, "polka dot" are subject to magnetism, distort and scatter chaotically, forget about the rules, give them freedom!
And we are again about this summer's IT shoes
Today we are discussing SPORTS SANDALS.
Urban options👍🏼
For visualization, we turn to Chanel - quilted, reasonably understandable, and straightforward forms, only a logo from the decor
In general, if you choose more budgetary options than Chanel, I would recommend abandoning the decor altogether because the accessories give out the cost of shoes in the first place.
For all occasions👌🏼
Slightly more sporty and, accordingly, more often than not, a little more comfortable, suitable both for the city and for suburban activities
A massive sole and the presence of a not very catchy, not sports decor will help to get away from a direct association with sports
These sandals are a summer alternative to sneakers, hence the stylization - they are combined with almost everything👌🏼, the options with dresses and skirts are the closest to me
Of course, we also do not exclude trousers, shorts, and bermudas.
Sometimes it seems that from year to year, we (in a global sense, we) move along the path of least resistance, choose simple solutions, and build them into a fashion cult.🙄
We all love dresses because we don't need to match them to the top or bottom, they are self-sufficient and beautiful, but the last few seasons are not the only ones
I'm talking about sets, in summer - about sets of a skirt with a top
They are everywhere, they allow us not to bother too much with the choice, but at the same time, they will enable us to experiment if we still want to
After all, no one bothers to stylize them separately.😉
Well, maybe not everything is as bad as it seemed to me at first? 🤔 I already had a knitted set of a skirt and a sweater last fall
It seems it's time to get a light version with a top.😉
You can experiment here in any direction - minimalism, infantilism, boho, classic, or sports,  choose to your taste.👌🏼
Along with the fashion of the 2000s, tennis aesthetics returned to us - polo, skirts, shorts, long sports socks ..
I can't say that I'm a crazy fan of all this
However, the new collaboration MSGM x Fila made an indelible impression on me.🤩
An incredible combination of this classic sport 🎾 with French tenderness and mysteriousness, unexpectedly and beautifully (after watching the video, you will understand what I mean)!
I especially liked the windbreaker with the Victorian collar! 😍 And we may wear wristbands as bracelets again very soon.😉
Must-Have for 2021 is a three-piece suit, an ideal thing for an urban summer, which can quickly be "retrained" from an office to a relaxed walking version.
Here are the main ways ta stylization:
Continuing the masculine style - add derbies, oxfords, monks, or any "muscular" shoes.
We play on contrasts - as opposed to the "man's" suit, we add heels and a feminine clutch.
We relax to the maximum comfort - we put on sandals, leather flip flops, + we take a shopper or a straw bag in our hands.
A selection from the spring-summer 2021 shows awaits you above👆🏼😉
We continue the topic of current shoes for the summer of 2021
In addition to the TOP models🏆and features that will be good for almost any type of shoe, no matter what you prefer😉 , today we are talking about INFLATED ELEMENTS
Sandals, flip-flops, slippers - the form is secondary
The primary condition is inflated straps; take an example from Jil Sander, Nanushka, Staud
From the pros - usually, these are very comfortable models in which the leg feels as comfortable as possible because the puffed straps practically do not rub!
A subtype of inflated strapы are gathered straps, which generally create the same bulky and puffy effect.
Summer is in full swing and let's see what we have for the summer 2021 shorts.
Let's start with what NOT to look at in the 2021 SHORTS category:
❌ "paper bag" is an echo of the 80s that recently conquered the catwalks and incredibly quickly conquered every wardrobe - from office to casual and sporty
But ...
it's time to say goodbye to him
I DON'T recommend such purchases this spring
🙅🏼‍♀️ We also wear it if we already have it(because it's not quite anti😉 yet), but I DON'T recommend buying.
❌Mini-mini-mini denim shorts to make it shorter and sexier - NO🙅🏼‍♀️ The situation is aggravated by a low rise, rips, protruding pockets, attritions.
Moving on to the actual shorts👇🏼
✅ Fit - high (in trousers and jeans, we already see a return to low, in shorts not yet), the waist accents.
✅ Shorts are loose, еhe legs dangle slightly in them.
✅ Length - medium (butt is covered entirely and another + 7-8 cm minimum) or even elongated, tending to the length of the bermuda
This length is also relevant for the denim shorts with which we started today.
❗️Important information - I suggest that all mini lovers switch to skirts, which we are shortening this summer.👌🏼
✅In the immediate sense, there is NO decor❌ in the figurative - a little further.
We continue the theme of the SHORTS of the summer
The main features were considered yesterday, we move on to the TOP🥇 models:
✅Classics - straight or slightly widened, of medium length - these are relevant from almost any material, starting from denim, then cotton, linen.
✅ Change the "paper bag" to shorts with pleats at the waist
If you are wondering, "What's the difference?" In the second version, the answer is that the folds are stitched and not created with the help of a belt; they are much more rigid and structured
By the way, the material for such shorts is also welcomed that keeps its shape.
✅ Summer novelty - knitted slightly "vintage" loose monochromatic options
For them, a scuffed and aged (slightly) look is welcome.
✅With us, leather options remain, the conditions are the same - a higher waist and no tight-fitting.
✅From decor (well, almost decor😝) - free raw edge, patchwork.
Our Collectors Appreciation Campaign is back! 
We’re giving away USD 1,000 to NFT buyers every day between now and 2 August
In yesterday's TOP of shorts, I forgot about men's cotton panties😂 The most hype trend of this summer!
Main features:
We wear it ourselves and put it on under trousers and jeans, but the elastic is visible to everyone.
Are you ready to try it? Or maybe already? 😉
For three days, we talked about shorts (if you missed it, you could find a complete set of information on )
Today we switch from mini SKIRTS, which I have already mentioned
We removed tight-fitting shorts further away, but with skirts, the opposite is true 👌🏼 Denim maxi and midi have been shortened to the point of indecency, and now it will not be hot in them even in the midst of summer.👍🏼
Today, in the our selection is mainly with heels to feel the difference😉
However, sandals, sneakers, and any flat shoes paired with a mini haven't been canceled, and if someone cancels, I will be the first among those who disagree! 🙋🏼‍♀️
In the hope of a normal and free from Covid-restrictions summer luxury fashion 
😂 Remember we said that Salvatore Ferragamo had released a  which will be sold only at the world's best resorts
So, now a new Dioriviera capsule from Dior and also limited for resorts - Saint Tropez, Cannes, Monaco, Capri, Ibiza..
the list is excellent, by the way, for the first time this year, the resorts of Montenegro
They went a little further, and at each of the resorts are planning an individual pop-up practically on the seashore🌊
Watching a 
Well, let's look at the Dioriviera capsule itself - the now-branded Dior print, the coveted Dior book tote bag + micro bags, panamas, bandanas, slates, and slipons with socks, pochno, overalls, shorts and crop tops - all in classic Dior black and white, yellow and red.
And, of course, Vespa creates the mood of the campaign ..
A particular mode of transport that is treated with awe and love in Italy💗 Nostalgia for the homeland of Maria Grazia Chiuri😉
A little information on SLIPONS - they are with us again 👌🏼 Straightforward to dress and give relaxation in the perception of the image
We choose in favor of:
✔️ monochromatic or with a simple, understandable print (for example, geometric print)
✔️without decor or with minimal,
✔️ on a classic or slightly raised sole.
Keep in mind that they look magical with midi skirts and dresses😍, not just jeans and trousers, and I never tire of repeating them - with socks.🧦
Today I will tell you about one more use of scarves this summer.
We put them under our hat and
✔️ we tie a large and sweeping bow under the chin
✔️ just leave the ends in "free flight,"
✔️ Another exquisite option (if the size of the scarf allows) is to make a loop around the neck - very sophisticated ☺️
✔️ if the bow in the front seems uncomfortable - tie it in the back😉
I'm sure you noticed the unusual hairstyle inherent in Bella Hadid
But, for the most part, she owes this one person, let's get acquainted - The master of surrealism grew up in California in a traditional Mexican family
He was inspired by the American youth subculture of the early 2000s, his mother and four sisters, and studied by the legend Jimmy Paul.
I follow my feelings, go with the flow, and don't repeat something
Instead, I am looking for inspiration in everything that surrounds me ...
In a swimsuit instead of a top for a walk around the city, in flip flops for a date, in socks with sandals for shopping, and in a pareo skirt for an exhibition ..
Where is the world heading? - some will ask, others will smile and wink, grin, but still others will try
It's nice that modern fashion gives freedom
Today we are talking about pareo/sarong skirts as part of urban outfits.
✔️ classic overlap/smell,
✔️ most often asymmetrical,
✔️ length from maxi to mini,
✔️ the presence of drapery is possible (if the fabric is flowing)
Skirt-sarong is relaxed, always accent and taking on much attention, but allowing for a completely any top✅ - T-shirt, top, cardigan
The only thing I would recommend to be more careful🙅🏼‍♀️ is with blouses
If the skirt is flowing and flying, it is better to balance this effect with cotton, knitwear, or dense textures
Separately, I would like to note the relevance of suits from such skirts with blouses (in the case of suits, blouses are allowed and welcomed).
Let's play some association? Summer..
What three words do you associate with this season?
Grass🌿 and flowers🌸, sun☀️ and clear sky☁️
Then we move on to colors,  grass and flowers are green and pink, and sun and sky are yellow and blue
Here are the color trends of summer 2021😂 We have already discussed everything except blue, today is his turn.
Light blue (maybe a little whitened, like clouds) can be presented in a classic cotton shirt, silk suit, chiffon dress, or even in authentic crochet
Enjoy and get inspired by the Spring / Summer 2021 runway.
Leather flip-flops
We all imagine what classic flip-flops look like, right? So, in leather, these are IT footwear for the summer of 2021
The most trendy options on inflated but flat soles, which in itself are a trend, but we'll talk about that later.
The "danger"❌ of flip-flops as city shoes is that they visually highlight all the imperfections of the leg, so if you have such, then it is better to pass by this option
The bone on the thumb will appear even more significant in them, and a slightly bent little finger may generally seem skewed.
In terms of stylization, it is difficult to come up with restrictions
They are perfect for dresses, shorts, trousers, bermudas, skirts..
and everything.
When I first looked at Alexander McQueen's Fall 2021 collection, I experienced strange emotions - for me, it was something between a vampire saga🧛‍♂️ and immersion in the soul of a flower..
It turned out that my last associations were closer to the truth.😊
The collection is based on a print inspired by anemones 🌸(an incredibly graceful and elegant flower)
They symbolize a time for healing, a time for rebirth and new life, a time for exploring the echoes of the past to enrich the future.
In addition to the special print, we add giant flounces, fluffy skirts, asymmetry, much embroidery (it looks almost like couture work)
And we have brand features - leather and denim, a mix of textures and structured everywhere, and always recognizable sleeves.
❗️ I was especially pleased with the attempt to show the stylization of these magical dresses in real life - a dress with metallic embroidery over trousers with sneakers 👍🏼
Summer Belts 2021
TOP 5🏆 options for summer belts according to :
✔️ Chain-belt (we talked in great detail about it and how to style it here in this 👉🏼✔️The belt is a belt bag that has won the proud title of the most practical
✔️Leather classics - yes
I especially like all the warm tones with a brown undertone😍 in combination with extra-fashionable green this year - the very thing
According to Vogue Italia , rivets and gems will soon join us as decor - I doubt it🤔 , but time will show us.
White belts were also noted - with a recommendation to select the perfect tone to match the outfit
I also like this combination, and summer is practically the only time when we can afford it.
✔️ Thin belts - in general, why not, primarily if we use the multi-layer effect, BUT!!! I saw in the same article a recommendation that such belts are suitable for short girls.😳 I was surprised..
how long has the horizontal division of the figure helped us add height? 😏 In general, forget🙅🏼‍♀️ about accent belts if there is a desire to add height visually
You want vertical lines, not the other way around.
✔️ A scarf is as an accent at the waist👌🏼
Collection Pre Fall 2021 Saint Laurent have name - "between two chairs" 🪑🔛🪑 (and this is not my subjective opinion, but an official comment from the brand - we crave structure, but freedom, comfort, but not sloppiness, we are in a huge wild world, but at the same time close to home)
It will be remembered for me by boots or leggings, as well as jeans, tights and leather trousers - no matter how much I look at them, I can't understand where the shoes end and the trousers begin, or maybe they don't end? 😉😂
Denim especially struck - right to the very heart.💔
The perfect way to visually lengthen your legs😍 Who wanted to appear taller? 😉
If you ask me about the most romantic and self-conscious modern brand, I will undoubtedly answer - Zimmermann
And the Resort 2022 collection is no exception
If you also want such aesthetics in your wardrobe, you can learn from them.🤓
So, 9 tricks that will make you look feminine and gentle:
(Part 1)
Volumetric shapes, contrasting with the shape of the body
In romance, there is no place for tight-fitting silhouettes.
Soft plastic - smooth transitions from one part to another
There are no corners and no rigid shapes.
Clothes silhouette - A or O
These two silhouettes evoke the necessary associations in us: femininity, tenderness, softness, and smoothness.
Smooth, rounded, and wavy lines
Flounces and ruffles, soft folds, and gathers will help us with this
With a minimum of vertical or horizontal lines, we focus on waves.
To be continued...
Let's continue😉
9 Tricks That Will Make Your Look Feminine and Delicate: (Part 2)
Play with proportions - oversize the model or a deliberate increase in proportions will do (for example, increased sleeves).
Lightweight, NOT massive shapes
We use thin fabrics (chiffon, silk, satin, poplin)
We use natural fabrics such as linen, cotton, poplin, and others
It is these fabrics that bring us closer to nature, create an aura of romance and naivety.
As a decoration, we use ethnicity, sewing, lace, as well as natural fabrics, they make the image more delicate.
Light colors will be ideal - beige, white, light gray and all light shades of bright colors (light green, blue, pink and others)
Bright colors in all their color can also be used
However, as accent colors, you should not make them basic.
Patchwork is back with us! Relevant for everything, starting with denim and continuing with jackets, shirts, trousers, bags, and more
If you think about it, there are three reasons why this is so:
✔️Back to the roots - ethnicity and patchwork are inextricably linked, namely, the desire for authenticity is now the main engine of fashion.
✔️After a hard year of imprisonment and quarantine, infantilism and brightness became an outlet and self-expression
Well, the patchwork satisfies both of these requirements - bright and a little childish😉
✔️ A conscious approach to consumption, recycling - you can say much marketing from the side of the industry or awareness of something fundamental
However, the fact remains that this is the main direction of fashion development today
Patchwork has historically been a solution to the lack of textiles and the latter's use to the maximum, this is inherent in it by nature itself👌🏼
What does patchwork mean to you? 🤔
For several days I received a question about the massive sole on summer shoes - how relevant and for how long?
Today is a visual selection on this topic and some comments👇🏼
We choose - massive, high, and, most importantly, uniform over the entire surface, without a strong change in height
The top of sandals can differ significantly in appearance, the principal feature is only the sole.
Prada, Gabriella Hearst, Loewe, Ganni, Michael Kors - these and not only these brands have implemented this trend in their summer collections in 2021, and, of course, the mass market is not lagging in this matter😉
❗️Be careful when choosing such shoes, because a low-quality, high and massive sole bends very badly and makes attempts to walk almost torture, therefore I urge you to pay special attention to convenience in this case already at the first fitting
If something seemed wrong, it will hardly be better further.
If you think you've already seen the craziest prints, you just haven't seen Fall 2021 Ashley Williams - a revolution🤪 of all rules and principles: kittens and puppies seasoned with nets, bows, and hearts, ghosts with beads, and strawberries with long-tailed rats😂
For real life, we can most likely take only one of the items from this collection and harmoniously fit it into our calm outfit.
Get the freshest 🥬 2000s-inspired  low rise jeans compilation +
crop tops
In 2021, it is possible and necessary!
What amazes me the most is Emily Ratajkowski, who 😳! Wait a minute!😳 gave birth to a son just 3 months ago
This is how the speed of rehabilitation of the press👌🏼
Each of us, I'm sure, heard about Birkenstock, let's say a few words about this useful summer trend 👍🏼 
So, orthopedic slates à-la birkenstock
Convenient, practical and ...
and useful! The foot often sinks a little in such slates, because the slates have walls at the edges and additionally protect the open foot, creating the effect of a foot bath.
Shoes are rather "rough", and simple understandable neighbors are very well suited for it:
✔️outfits in basic colors, laconic shapes, for example, straight trousers + shirts
✔️ You can also experiment with dresses, but don't overdo it 🙅🏼‍♀️ with excessive tenderness - give preference to dresses with clear graphic silhouettes.
✔️ well, here, too, socks lit up in styling🧦😜
Minimalism is one of the main directions of development of the fashion industry, bursts of brightness and the invasion of the style of the 2000s as exceptions that confirm the rule.
Today about MINIMALISM, which, in contrast to the frequent mistake, is by no means equal to 🙅🏼‍♀️ a white shirt and straight trousers
Minimalism is a deep and self-sufficient style that you will not get bored with.
The main features of minimalism:
▪️Practicality
▫️Lack of unnecessary details
▪️Functional cut
▫️Minimum accessories, and if there are any, they also comply with all the principles of minimalism
▪️Basic calm colors (not necessarily black, white, beige, and gray, it can be other colors, but in their muted dusty form)
▫️ Absence of the most relaxed prints and decor
▪️Main materials: wool, cotton, knitwear, silk, satin, satin.
The best visuals to convey the mood will be Khaite and Jil Sander campaigns
Get inspired!
Every morning with a cup of coffee☕️, when I look at new fashion shows and street style, I feel sad about the fact that I am not familiar with knitting needles and crochet😂 I wish I could knit myself ...
Grandma's knitting has gained such momentum that you can't keep up with it! I haven't signed up for knitting courses yet, but today I made a selection, when I finished, I realized that, in principle, there is no such detail in our wardrobe wherever this trend gets.
🧶Dresses🧶Tops🧶Suits🧶Skirts🧶Pants🧶Shorts
🧶Cardigans 🧶Jackets🧶Ponchos🧶Bags🧶Shoes
🧶Swimsuits🧶Decorations 🧶Panamas
Just recently, a fashion week in Milan ended, and although it was largely held offline, it was extremely difficult to get somewhere, because the number of guests was severely limited due to Сovid security considerations 😷 Well, no one forbids walking around the city at all, so street -Everyone could enjoy the style.
On such days I like to just put on something insanely comfortable and wind circles around the streets of Milan (which I did this year), to help me endless warming coffee ☕️ or delicious Italian ice cream (depending on the season).
I rarely take a photo myself, but on the streets, there are quite often running photographers of all genders and ages (hurray, the genre of street photography is now more developed than ever)
And we just have to choose the best among these collections, and, of course, analyze
I will tell and show everything that I see😉👇🏼
Let's start with the prints, we have the FLORAL🌺🌷🌸
By the way, we do not raise the issue of gender🙅🏼‍♀️, we talk about everything regardless of gender😉
And also there was a lot of abstraction and geometry, tie-dye lit up and paisley "cucumbers" were repeatedly noticed.
We continue to analyze Milan's street style
Further on the shoes, on the streets of Milan, we had
By the way, it was not without heels either, although the feeling that it was not for real does not leave me, because in real life there is a minimum of heels in Italy, and even more so in hot summer😉
We continue the  and today about "safe" swimsuits
Most likely, you have already heard that when washing synthetic swimsuits in a large one, microplastic fibers are washed out, which enter the world ocean, posing a threat to the life of all its inhabitants.
More and more brands are putting on the agenda the production of swimwear less hazardous to nature, and every year new names appear that are built only on this idea
Here are just a few of them -  , , , 
And here are some simple ways to make the world cleaner:
🌱Give preference to natural fibers (and this is not only about linen and cotton, but modern technologies also make it possible to use hemp, rubber, and many other materials, unexpected at first glance, in the production of swimwear).
🌱Avoid primary plastic (choose swimwear made from recycled plastic);
🌱Pay attention to the dyes used to dye your swimwear - certified non-toxic dyes make our world a better place.
🌱Have to hand wash swimsuits - this will prolong their life and allow them to be used longer and more productively and reduce the effect of washing out of microplastics.
🌱 don't forget about recycling (hand over old swimwear for recycling)
🌱Choose brands that think about our future, I know that many people consider this to be empty talk, but even these are meaningful and make us feel, so start small😉
Today, a little inspiration for styling my favorite trendy sandals from the streets, or rather from Instagram feeds😂 More details about combining and styling were 
And let's continue the theme of CROCS, let's get a little more detailed
A common noun comes from the name of a particular brand, which already says a lot! We all know what crocs are
We all represent them
This year they reached the climax (although who knows what still lies ahead) of their popularity.
We now wear those rubber flip flops of a strange blown shape, with a closed nose and holes all over the surface..
for the faint of heart, I ask you to step away from the screen 📲 with classic trousers, suits, and even skirts
And here again, it is a matter of achieving the cherished relaxation and ease of the image
You can experiment with color as much as you dare, from neutral white to bright acidic shades, you can also add jibbits.
I propose to look at the beautiful flower greenhouse🌺🌸🌹🌷💐 (or garden, whichever you prefer) from the Spring 2021 Valentino show.
I can't say that I dream of such a wardrobe, but I would include one such thing😉
Where there is action, there is also opposition - the law of fashion life, which always works
Last week, we talked to you about minimalism and its basic rules, but we cannot deny that there are colors, brightness, and shine in parallel with it.
If you want to add shine to your wardrobe (in the most literal sense), then here are some valuable tips:
The look with sequins looks perfect in monochrome color, and we take into account all the details, even accessories, and jewelry.
Play with textures to make them look interesting
A plain cotton T-shirt with a sequin skirt is an option for real life, but a festive blouse with such a skirt is only "on the way out" (and in this case, I would add an "extinguishing" element)
If you nevertheless decide to combine several parts from sequins in one bow, then act in the opposite direction from the previous rule - choose the most similar texture (sequins must be of the same size and shape).
And let's catch the glitter inspiration✨ from summer shows 2021👆🏼
Leonie Hanne reminds us that summer☀️ is the perfect time for fine braids nearby our beautiful eyes:
✔️ it is comfortable and hair does not get into the eyes👍🏼
✔️ conceptually and summerly
✔️ relevant in summer 2021👌🏼
And here are some more examples on the topic of the previous hairstyle for the summer:
-can be located not only nearby the face but also a little further along with the top layer of the hairstyle,
-and you can braid them, as in the first photo, but the truth is then such a hairstyle cannot be called fast and easy😂
Happy experiments! 😉
The best denim сouple this summer👇🏼
Prada Denim Bralette + Floor-Length Relaxed Oversized Jeans
Her success🤔 - the maximum frankness and sexuality of the bralette is balanced by the baggy agender silhouette of jeans
It makes you flutter but does not cause excessive primal feelings (a rule that works with almost any things - it is recommended for use).
My heart is won, and I enjoy ☺️
Since we started talking yesterday about denim, we won't bypass the last show of Diesel Spring 2022 😉 Deconstructivism in the collection has gone wild - Glenn Martens has gone all out.
My main conclusion, which we will have to live with for several more years, this collection reinforces the trend for jeans with an "unusual fit": all kinds of asymmetry, "jeans on jeans," cuffs, and whatever comes to mind.
And one more interesting note about Diesel Spring 2022, it seems that the idea of trousers-boots is exploited not only by Saint Laurent, remember we admired So, Diesel has its vision of the same issue - unusual silhouettes, brighter colors, more freedom, but the essence is the same
So you have to put on such pants😂 Ready?
One of the most anticipated shows this summer was Jacquemus Spring 2022
I am sure that we will refer to this show thousands of times over the coming year, but for now, I will share my chaotic emotions (Part 1) 👇🏼
💗There was less pink than expected after Simon's posts on Insta, with a pair in the lead - pink + fuchsia + orange
💗The ropes and straps not only did not go away but on the contrary expanded their sphere of influence
💗Bralettes also repeat their success and do not think to hide
💗 Shortened sheepskin coat (once it was already 🤔)
💗 Bodysuits and shirts with triangular cutouts in the rib area are still incredibly sexy😍
Let's continue about Jacquemus Fall 2021 (Part 2):
💗It was not without a mountain theme - balaclavas, mitts, and boots precisely like those that I use for hiking in the Alps (now we can also wear in the city👌🏼)
💗new feature - neck overlap (for tops, dresses, cardigans)
💗 slits on trousers, dresses, tops, and even coats are everywhere
💗 I remember a backpack with fasteners on the chest, imitating a harness
💗 cardigans and blouses on a chain - sexy trend of the next season
💚 glasses with bright green glasses replace next year's yellow leaders
💗 men proudly put on their cycling pants
💗 folds at the waist of the trousers (just talked about Diesel)
💗 homemade fur slippers, on the street we don't no longer change shoes
💗 trousers and leggings with slits are our everything, but skirts with suspenders are something new.
💗 we change the panamas for caps that cover the neck, just like for babies up to a year 👶🏼
Good morning, from the fried egg of the Moschino Spring 2022 collection, the latter had so many edibles that it sounds more like a joke🙃🙂 or at least irony.
And a word about timeless classics - flat slippers
It will be a perfect option👌🏼 for adherents of the classics and those who do not accept experiments
Usually, leather or fabric is used for such
The most relevant will be monochromatic colors - basic and pastel colors in the first positions.
❗️The main thing to pay attention to - do not to overplay with the decor
The most suitable options will look WITHOUT it or with its minimum amount
I want to ask you, how do you like the interpret the classic Burberry trench coat from the last Spring 2022🤔 show?
In general, the idea of the Burberry Spring 2022 show is even slightly contrary to the general trend of genderless
They tried to create not genderless heroes from the models (as in many other shows of the past fashion weeks), but, on the contrary, exploited the idea of a warrior.
Combat chest plates, many elements of workwear, valves, pockets, silhouettes of skeletons and ghosts, a mesh as a symbol of chain mail, and, by the way..
girls in the men's collection were also present
Ok, now I see, the popular norms genderless is there, just a little inverted😉😊
Those who read me have long known my unbridled love for overalls💜 This, of course, is not a must-have for everyone, but I predict a great future for them, and their annually growing popularity confirms this👍🏼
And today we are looking at how different they are🤩
❣️ inspired by work uniforms (Alberta Ferretti, Salvatore Ferragamo)
❣️Feminine and elegant (Chanel)
❣️ short and playful (Valentino)
❣️masculine "costume" (Hermès)
❣️disko style (Balmain)
❣️leather (Burberry, Celine)
❣️ and even the jumpsuit is a "second skin" (Marine Serre)
Today we will talk about terry fabrics
Let's take a little more detail - vintage fashion for dresses, suits, swimwear, bags of terry is one of the most controversial issues this summer.
And if it all started with beachwear and jackets, then Dior Resort 2022, presenting a dress-gown in mini and midi length (for those who missed this novelty - look at the first photo), does not give us any more right to doubt this trend
😆 Here, we add Miu Miu terry bomber jackets in the spring-summer show 2021, Bottega green robes, and a pink terry men's cardigan from Prada.
I do not urge you to run and buy, but you already need to look closely😉 Next year, it will be in hot trends👌🏼
How do you like this terry panacea?
A couple of weeks ago, we talked about trendy but we forgot about knitted PANAMAS, and today, I decided to talk a little about this mega-positive trend of summer 2021.
The popularity of these funny Panama hats began in the days of the protracted quarantine, when the creator of the RAT HAT brand, one of the main adherents of the new fashion for knitted hats, sat around at home and decided to start knitting
The emphasis was on sustainability (leftover yarn is used for knitting) and on the need for people in hard times of something kind and good❤️
The selection rule is elementary - the brighter and sillier, the better! 👍🏼
Today, this is a global trend that gives smiles
Do you already have one? ☺️
But what the panama hats looked like on the catwalk (as it should be - not as flashy as on the street)
The first who tried it was the Italian brand Marco Rambaldi, then Philosophy di Lorenzo Serafini quickly pulled up and it started💨 Fendi, Amir, Thom Brown ..
By the way, in the male version there are almost more such panamas than in the female one😉
One of my good friends cut her hair yesterday, and when I saw her, I thought -  to the wolf regiment of thousands of TikTok and Instagram bloggers 🐺  has been added another one
And today, a little about this trend.
Wolfcut🧑🏻‍🦰 is the most fashionable haircut for summer 2021 that came to us from Korea
Strictly speaking, this is a mixture of 2 haircuts: mullet and shaggy
With wolf cut, the hair is cut in layers from the crown, and bangs are made (these are shaggy features), but at the back of the head, the hair is left long (borrowed from mallet) - it turns out like wool from wolves, which is slightly longer at the withers.
Suitable - thin, but thick enough hair, on too thin hair it is necessary to achieve volume is difficult, and as a result, a completely different story turns out
The strands are stacked from the face
The general appearance of the hairstyle is always disheveled and a little messy.
I love her for her ability to be different🤩 Is it one step from crazy extravagance to incredible femininity? YES if you are Lady Gaga👌🏼
Vintage pink Alessandra Rich and black and white embroidery by Giuseppe Di Morabito is the case when the owner dyes the dresses 😉
A New Trend for Silence🤫  to the sound of the desert and footsteps on the sand and the entire  we generally listened to the sounds of brand new creaking floors😊
Well, why not? But nothing distracts😉
And the most couture at Balenciaga, in my opinion, were hats👒, and from the exciting things, we again see terry robes, which were talked about a few days ago (true, as couture no one else did not imagine).
Uterque offers an excellent way to style long-sleeved jumpsuits in its catalog - use them as a top layer on a shirt / T-shirt and tie the top of the jumpsuit in the manner of a jacket at the waist.
It looks very even👍🏼 By the way, Brioni used the same method in the latest Spring 2022 Menswear collection.
We take into service👌🏼 Anyone with long sleeves will do as a jumpsuit, cotton or linen will look especially good, you can try with denim, but they may be too tight for such experiments.
I love to look at the collections of The Row
Their strength is in the details - let's focus on them👌🏼 (Part 1)
✔️ shirt on a shirt (fasten the top a little less than the bottom, bend the sleeves, contrasting colors)
✔️ eternal monochrome (already a trademark of the brand),
✔️ a lot of crinkled fabrics and new textures - the thinnest (in the hole) as if starched jersey
✔️ ankle purse,
✔️ pants tied at the bottom (you won't surprise us with this, but still),
🧷 pin shirt as costume jewelry
To be continued...
Continuing on The Row Spring 2022👇🏼 Part 2
✔️ belt from a trench coat to a sloppy knot,
✔️ cropped trousers for long - this is something new 😊
✔️ terracotta with electro blue is my new love 💙
✔️ transparent scarves (like a mom's as a child)
✔️7 mini-bags on one shoulder - so that everything fits precisely 😂
✔️ a piece of fishing line wrapped in a thread can be a great belt 👍🏼
In general, as always, a lot of exciting things, a true trendsetter!
This year, at couture shows, from the amount of tulle and organza, a little cheekbone reduces 🥴- well, it's very sweet 🧁🎂🍦🍧🍥🍭 (although ..
was it otherwise?) I honestly, although I am a lover of dresses and romance, I prefer something more modern vision of couture 🤷‍♀️
But princesses Sunday's selection should be to their liking 😘
After another incredibly hot weekend, I confirm from personal experience that for such ☀️☀️☀️ summer, there is nothing better than a trendy pair = shorts + shirt.
Here are the main points to choose from:
✔️Material: cotton, linen, lyocell, a terry effect is welcomed, but most importantly, to be natural☝🏼
✔️Color: Basic natural tones or pajama tones (pink / blue stripes) are favorites🏆, but bright colors are relevant, so choose your style👌🏼
✔️ Silhouette: oversized pajamas, shorts - the most similar to men's underpants😝, shirt - with short or long sleeves of a free silhouette.
And here is a little remark about shirts with short sleeves - the most relevant silhouette will be if the short sleeve is as long as possible (sorry for the contradiction😂), i.e., the sleeve practically reaches the elbow
It is as wide as possible (we focus on the male silhouette of a shirt under a jacket).
By styling a pajama suit SHORTS + SHIRT:
✔️ The shirt is asymmetrically tucked into shorts or asymmetrically fastened;
✔️Add a crop top and a shirt on top;
✔️If the sleeves are long - casually roll-up or, on the contrary, pull the shirt off the shoulder to get a deliberately elongated sleeve;
✔️ We put on a swimsuit instead of a top;
✔️If you want femininity and even a little kitsch - add a lace corset;
✔️For shoes, we continue the relaxed theme - sandals, leather flip flops, crocs, or just flat slippers, excluding high heels and overly delicate motifs.
Today  I worked closely with the luxury Italian brand The Attico
Have you heard of this?
It is only about five years old, created by two successful influencers  and 
Before the launch of the brand, each was engaged in the design, study in Milan Marangoni, brand consulting, the experience of editors in fashion magazines - in general, everything is as it should be👌🏼
Interestingly, the girls' tastes are, to put it mildly, opposite: the first is an eternal experimenter, and the second is a real minimalist
And at the junction of these views, the corporate style of The Attico appeared, which is all permeated with Italy, or rather its luxurious side: palace interiors, villas, an abundance of decor - hence, by the way, the name The Attico.
Three main trends in the category of sunglasses 🕶 that can be applied regardless of the shape of the glasses you prefer:
Colored translucent lenses - the most hype color of the summer of 2021 - yellow, but in general, any pastel and not very catchy colors are relevant.
Accent frames and temples
If you are not ready to play with shapes but want to add brightness to your glasses, try to look at glasses with bright temples that will stand out and differ from the glasses' frame
The only limitation is that I do not recommend using rhinestones and gems as an accent
Let's focus on shape or color.
Eyeglass chains continue to be relevant and very comfortable
The choice is varied; such a chain is, first of all, a decoration, but only secondly - a functional
It can be a chain, or it can consist of irregularly shaped pearls, another modern version of the summer of 2021 is a chain of beads.
On the eve of autumn, we are discussing the topic of cropped outerwear
It seems that we are waiting for her triumphant return in the upcoming autumn-winter season, Fall 2021 and Resort 2022 shows are full of cropped sheepskin coats, down jackets, bombers, vests, and jackets
But I want to note right away that this is NOT a bolero from 2000 - on the contrary, we choose the very voluminous silhouettes.
Above is a small selection of new collections
I know that there will be many disagreements with such a length, but to mentally prepare you, I started talking about it back in the summer😂
Today we will talk about the basic dress, which is always with us from year to year - the silhouette and styling methods change a little bit- but in general, it continues to be with us -  SHIRT-DRESS👌🏼
Here are the main features of the current modern shirt dress:
✔️ keeps its shape, the material should not be🙅🏼‍♀️ too flowing,
✔️ length - sufficient to assert that this is not a shirt, but still a dress (shirts also have a place but with a different stylization),
✔️ avoid🙅🏼‍♀️ fitting, we choose silhouette is oversized or close to it,
✔️exclude🙅🏼‍♀️ fitting, will be better choosing straight or even slightly widening silhouette towards the bottom.
Separately, I will note my favorite way of styling shirt-dresses (as well as any dresses with significant cuts) - we wear them with trousers / bermuda / shorts😍
Be sure to try if you haven't yet.
You know my love for Valentino😍 Therefore, sorry in advance for the possibly not impartial assessment of the Fall 2021 Couture show
He is indescribably beautiful💚🧡💙 85 images and almost everyone is in the very heart💘
As always, thesis😉
💙Capes and their variations were given a special place in the collection, some are weird, but in general, I love capes and am glad of their firm position in 2021
🤍 Styling with lightly gathered leggings, which actively used in a good half of the bows, I liked it
It has a future and application in real life
💚The colors are amazing, I want this brightness👌🏼
💛Prints are watercolor drawings; they seem to have come off the paintings of artists (although they are, it was the paintings of the artists that were the official inspiration)
🧡 There were many feathers, but I do not think this is their triumphant return to our lives, rather this is a tribute to Couture.
But don’t worry, princess dresses have also found their place, this is Valentino, and his personalized dresses were the most at the last Oscars
I did not keep accurate statistics, but it seems to me and not only at last year, they fascinate ..
✨ Feather hats also amaze the imagination and return to the genuine concept of Couture.
It is not the first summer that bermuda shorts delight us with their comfort and style, but if earlier we talked about them instead as a part of a suit bermuda then this year, we are infinitely expanding the boundaries of their use
But let's start the classics, the perfect pair💕: Bermuda + blazer, blazer can be elongated (a good example was at the Salvatore Ferragamo show) and practically overlap shorts / Bermuda shorts or, on the contrary, remain deliberately shortened (Chanel offers us this option).
Slightly more relaxed compared to the previous pair: Bermuda + vest, it can be either a suit or things utterly alien to each other (like Philosophy di Lorenzo Serafini)
Boho aesthetics: Bermuda + lace, my favorite image in this style from Valentino💔
And we continue to stylize the bermuda
Casual, sports: bermuda shorts + lose shirt, you can tuck the shirt inside or use it as a top layer on top/shirt/t-shirt
If you want to go into sports - the same logic, but choose more athletic shoes.
Romance: Bermuda + blouse, ideal if the blouse will be with accents - Victorian collar, voluminous sleeves, etc
In this pair, it is better to avoid excessive relaxation and tuck the blouse.
Marine motives: Bermuda + sweatshirt/sweater, the first association with the sea and yachts, because it is the wind on the ship that makes us, even on a hot day, when we chose Bermuda or shorts, put on something warmer (only last weekend I rode on a small yacht on the Garda (this is, of course, a lake, not a sea, but the essence is the same) and very much regretted that I didn't wear my favorite sweatshirt, although outside was + 30😊)
The hot trend of  2021 - "networks" will perfectly fit here.
Do you know which color pair is leading after shows Fall 2021, Resort 2022? 
Red + Fuchsia, the brightness is off the scale! Jacquemus, Max Mara, Gucci, Marc Jacobs, Burberry, Raf Simons confirm the above😉
Thanks to Hermes, many of us have put on clogs this summer
We talked with you about them and  back at the beginning of summer
But at the beginning of autumn, they are no less perfect, for example, with socks🧦
We are looking for ways to style in the fashion show Hermes spring 2021 that started it all
It is total color and simple understandable shapes.
In the modern world of fashion, is it impossible to ignore the topic of androgyny? 👩🏼‍💼👨🏼‍💼🤵👩‍⚖️ Fashion, as a social phenomenon, first responds to changes in society and clearly shows this to us
We are already accustomed to masculine motives in the women's wardrobe
Now we are waiting for the transformation of men's collections
Let's look today at Alexander McQueen spring 2022 Menswear.
The collection is inspired by the paintings and works of William Blake, an English creator of the early 19th century
Endless zippers paired with ruffles flounces on a tuxedo vest and coat, unusual prints, and an almost evening dress - all of this is endowed with meaning and inspired by history.
A few days ago, we talked in great detail in addition to this today, a few words about denim.
Denim bermuda shorts are the most modern urban classics for the summer; they are good:
✔️with basic T-shirts, tops and T-shirts;
✔️ with cropped blazers and jackets;
✔️ in total denim looks;
✔️ with shirts for release as a top layer or tucked in.
For shoes - mostly comfortable👍🏼 and on a flat run (sandals, slippers, clogs and sneakers), but the heel looks great with them👌🏼
When choosing, please pay attention to the fit; free silhouettes are now at their peak, but it is easier and more varied to stylize straight lines (without excess volume), in any case, we exclude a solid fit🙅🏼‍♀️
Bright colors can be afforded NOT only in summer, and autumn is a great time for color experiments
For me, the color looks somehow unique on pantsuits, and the more classic or even masculine costume and the brighter the color, the better👌🏼
We are inspired by street style, we are charged with color!
Total denim is gaining momentum📈 the degree of trend is growing with the release of new denim collections and the emergence of more and more new collaborations with the luminaries of the denim industry: Levi's and MiuMiu, Levi's® for Valentino, the Prada jeans collection...
Total denim is close to me👍🏼: convenience, comfort and practicality and style, what else is needed for the ever-running stylist, who also works like a child's mother🙅🏼‍♀️
And, just in case, I clarify that when collecting a denim bow, there is no need to select elements of color in color, the play of shades can, on the contrary, make your outfit more enjoyable and deeper.
Let's enjoy denim street style, and we see total denim is very diverse.
The 2022 cruise collections are full of leggings
I'm sure this is a new trend for the next warm season
Valentino, Nina Ricci, Dior, Lanvin, Burberry, Gucci, Max Mara - this is an incomplete list of those who actively introduce leggings into their collections.
Don't shout at once a drawn-out: "Noooo!" we do not have to wear them alone 😂 The stylization is very decent😉 Leggings will be rather an alternative to tights, and their variety is just as huget: from neutral to flashy colors, with logos, patchwork, cuts at the bottom, and draperies all over the leg.
Yesterday I opened my Milano fashion week, and my first show was 💜Fendi
There were many familiar faces and IT-clothes 2021.
I have mountains of pleasure, great mood, and thousands of photos catch the last first-hand at the exit
Today is Friday, which means it's time to talk about the ECO-agenda
I decided to share a piece of Italy and tell you today about the most famous vintage shop in Milan - He is ten years old, but all the most prominent influencers and those indifferent to fashion already know him (now you are among them😉).
At the head of everything, of course, is the fight against uncontrolled consumerism🥊 and the popularization of the idea of   ecological choice
The main task is to rethink the concept of the vintage, now it's not a "dusty story," but a new life🌱And the first thing that strikes at the entrance to the store is incredible brilliance🔴🟠🟡🟢🔵🟣 and an abundance of color!
The boutique itself resembles a Parisian apartment - antique furniture, gold and wood for decoration, and a lot of green.
Collections in the store are of a wide range of prices - from reasonably affordable to exclusive and very expensive
I recommend stopping by and feeling a unique atmosphere - Foro Buonaparte, 74, Milano.
And now that you know what kind of place is, I can continue this topic and tell you about their collection, which has an incredible success👌🏼
I'll start from afar
If you have lived in Italy for at least a year or just traveled a lot here, you most likely have a classic bandana shawl in a "peisly" print
These are sold here in almost every tourist place, and if you suddenly forgot a hat in the summer heat, then most likely you will buy just such a scarf for 5 euros to save yourself from the scorching sun (this was the case with me, three times, therefore me as much as three 😂).
So, the vintage boutique offers us a whole collection made from such Madame Pauline Vintage Bandana shawls-caftans, dresses, shorts, shirts, sweatshirts, bags, and even shoes in an infinite number of colors.
The collection has an indescribable success! 👌🏼 Let's enjoy the photos of famous influencers above
The entire collection can be viewed in Milan near the Sforza Castle or on the boutique's website.
How do you feel about the most comfortable and relaxed T-shirt dresses?
What to look for when choosing and styling? 👇🏼
🔵 length matters here; it is best to avoid mini options that are too literal in T-shirts.
🟣 do not take too tight options; such a dress should be slightly or even substantially loose.
🟠 I recommend mixing such dresses with relaxed shoes, mainly on a flat run, although the options with a polo collar look very good with heels too😉
All weekend was in anticipation of the street style ahead of the Dolce & Gabbana SS2022 show.
I went, looked, filmed, a little disappointed 😔 Incredibly crowded, poorly organized meeting of guests and work of photographers, the street style itself was all hastily and not as bright as I expected 🤷‍♀️
Out of a thousand frames, I chose the best ones to convey at least a drop of the atmosphere that I painted myself 😂 (in fact, everything was not so beautiful).
I conclude my "street run" with the Philosophy di Lorenzo Serafini show
A worthy completion and only pleasure 👍🏼 Street style was not accidental and ideally corresponded to the spirit of the current Fall 2021 collection (in advance, I will say that the new SS2022 collection shown has little in common with it 😉).
Bright university-themed jumpers, jersey vests, boots with a rough quadrant toe, golf and socks, plaid pleated mini, bright coats, and many favorite fashion influencers💚
I have one skirt wholly covered with sequins - in case you need to cheer up ..
I take it out several times a season
It works 100%! Recommended👍🏼 I've already given a couple of tips on styling sequins in everyday life, and today we enjoy the street style and remember that the perfect pair for such a skirt:
And also - sneakers, slip-on, sandals or brogues with socks 👌🏼
Yesterday, after a post about sequined skirts, you asked for more examples with flat shoes
The Fall 2021 Celine show and Hedi Slimane's now recognizable style: sequins + parkas came to my mind, mountain boots, sequins + grandfather's sweaters and lace-up boots, sequins + cossacks, and down jackets, gems + oversized leather jackets.
And at the last men's biker show, the same rules worked: sequins were mixed with oversized jeans, with Cossacks, with shoes with massive soles, with biker jackets and leather vests from the 90s.
We mix the contrasting textures and styles, and we will have a new Celine!
Oh, everyone's beloved classic converse sneekers has been modified for a collab with one of the craziest modernists, Rick Owens😈
The Converse x DRKSHDW capsule collection changes the shape of the nose to a square and lengthens the tongue; the color palette is classic - black and white
The collection is already available on the official websites of Converse, RickOwens, and Rick Owens boutiques.
I don't even know what I think about it yet 😳 I look and try to understand.
We continue the denim theme, and today we are about cuts, rips, and holes
Over the past ten years we have completely abandoned them, then they began to appear again in the form of neat cuts, which in turn grew and now they again acquired the most "untidy" appearance and turned into huge holes.
As for me, in general, I am not a prude on this issue, and I do not see anything wrong with this trend, but I still prefer it in my modest manifestation - neat cuts in a limited number, but the streets were filled with another😂 Watch and let's inspired!
If you have ever wondered why a Dior silk scarf costs 400 euros😳, then you will be interested in the video - how it is created - 
Particularly impressive is how the print appears - from ink sketches on canvas to screen printing
By the way, this black and white print is my favorite 🖤🤍
I know that many of us gladly met the "mesh" trend (I am one of them) and have already introduced it into our wardrobe
It can be a dress, skirt, tunic, blouse, shoes or just a bag.
But the networks have caught not only the female half of our fashion community but the male half also
I made a selection from men's collections for everyone who finds it difficult to visualize how to catch a loved one on the net! 😉
Valentino knit polo set with shorts, Stefan Cooke sweater with large holes, Rick Owens double tees, Burberry mesh accessory, Dsquared2 chain mail, Ermenegildo Zegna perforated sweater, and Bottega beaded top.
Streetstyle pleases with its ideas and aesthetics, but the question often arises - how can this be implemented in real life? 🤔
The same is with the trend - a jacket for a naked body, we have met this before, but this year, it seems, the intensity of the trend has increased significantly📈
Here are some ideas to wear a jacket to make you don't appear to be naked.
✔️ beige bodysuit, top (maximum fit and color matching the skin will give the effect as close as possible to nudity)
✔️ double-breasted jacket with NOT a very deep neckline (fasten it with all the buttons)
✔️ a small bralette, which you won't immediately notice if you fasten one button of a jacket at its level (ideally, also flesh-colored).
If you suddenly thought that the green color left us along with the summer of 2021, you are mistaken
The Fall-Winter 2021 collections continue to offer us herbal (and not only) green, so don't take it far away - we will stylize in the autumn wardrobe and will make the picture of our life brighter!
Bottega Venetta, of course, continues to be the ambassador, Ganni, Salvatore Ferragamo, Kenzo, Raf Simons, Stella McCartney, and many more familiar names are also among the greens😉
A white blazer will probably fit into any wardrobe without exception - do you prefer relaxed sport-chic or a fan of classics, or maybe you prefer romance? So, let's style the white blazer:
✔️ The easiest and most unmistakable option is with blue jeans and a white T-shirt.
✔️With shorts - options from denim, suit classics, and, of course, the most top pair of 2021 - a jacket with Bermuda is suitable.
✔️ A blazer as a dress, if the length of the blazer allows it to be done😉
✔️ blazer with leggings and sneakers - according to the precepts of Lady Dee.
✔️ blazer with dress - a romantic silhouette and a masculine blazer will be the perfect match.
✔️Total white - with white trousers, jeans or a skirt
✔️ Play on contrasts - a white blazer on a black base, for example, black trousers and a top.
We continue the theme of white  blazers with the complete opposite and one of the leaders among outerwear for warm autumn - a leather blazer
He doesn't plan to give up his positions either in this or the next few years.
Here are some tips for choosing it👇🏼
A straight masculine silhouette, without any particular signs of fitting, if you want to, then you can  fit it with a belt.
The length is sufficient to cover the hips
We avoid shortened scanty options🙅🏼‍♀️
Dense texture, it doesn't have to be 100% genuine leather
It can be a substitute or an ECO version, but in any case, pay attention to the fact that the material does not hang but keeps its shape.
Among the most basic and most compatible options, the first is black, but you can choose and colored ones
Still, I would recommend focusing on sufficiently saturated colors and avoiding pastels color that compete with the character of masculinity.
Logomania..
how many times did she come back to us👍🏼, then it became a sign of bad taste👎🏼 - this vicious circle does not plan to end😉 tremble all who love and wrinkle their noses those who hate
Logomania is at its peak in 2021, and you hardly failed to notice it, right?
It all started with local slogans on T-shirts and ended up with a total logo, so there is simply no free space🙈
In the fall, we received another greeting from the 70s in the face of denim overalls
I haven't yet seen the peak of his popularity, and I only remember the times when this was the prerogative of deeply "pregnant expectant mothers, and now a hit" for everyone!
There will not be any problems with styling
The most popular pair is a white T-shirt and sneakers, for a colder season we change a T-shirt for a shirt or a sweater
And, by the way, for those who want an absolute immersion in the hippie aesthetics, Cowboy Boots or any other suede shoes will be helpful (for denim generally a special love with suede).
What a positive vision of the trends of Autumn Winter 2021-2022 performed by 
Four fashion editors Alex Harrington, Poppy Kain, Camilla Nickerson, and Julia Sarr-Jamois show us how to wear fashion trends of the upcoming season using the example of Gigi Hadid, Adut Akech, Edie Campbell , Lila Moss, Hailey Bieber
See in more detail😉
I carefully reviewed and formulated the main ones in my opinion👇🏼
Prints, catsuits and bombers
Bright outerwear
Mixes of textures and silhouettes
Total color
Mesh and knitwear
Sequins, sequins, sequins ...
Colored makeup
Leather gloves
Double, triple and more stripes
You MUST HAVE a knitted dress of all kinds of relevant and worthy dresses for the coming autumn.
So, this fall, it could be:
Midi or maxi chunky knit
Not too tight, loose, and widening to the bottom, the sleeves can be wide, but always remember when choosing the last that we still wear outerwear on them, and if you have something even more oversized, then yes, you can take it
Classic outerwear will crumple wide knitted sleeves and turn them into a crumpled rag😏
Bodycon knitted dress
A year ago, it was not in great recognition, but 2021 changed its fate
At the same time, remember that even a tight-fitting knitted dress should not be too thin, the density of texture here decides everything, and it should be significant
From the decor - numerous cutouts are welcome.
And if someone doubts that knitted vests are still with us - look at a selection of Fall Winter 2021 2022 shows: from classics (Staud, Bevza) and grandma's vests (Kiko Kostadinov) to shine (Balmain), prints (DSquared), and maxi volume (Raf Simons, Kenzo).
According to Tagwalk, one of the key trends for the upcoming spring and summer, based on the SS 2022 shows, will be ...
drum roll FRINGE! Again she is dear😂 The growth was 38.8%, so if you are one of those who wondered how long it will be and is it worth it?
YES! There will only be more! 👌🏼
What does the modern "little black dress" look like?
Sexy, revealing, tight-fitting, maxi or midi length, with a high slit or cutouts everywhere and everywhere
Application in real life, of course, is not easy for him to find, but it is not forbidden to admire😉
How I like the Resort 2022 Jil Sander collection - what are the ideal shapes, the right accents, deep textures, and a few, but unique prints🤍🤎🖤 I like EVERYTHING, but not just like it, but I know exactly where and when I could wear it - and this is very pleasing!
What was especially memorable🧡
"Everything artistic has to have something functional, and it has to serve the person." - Lucy Meyer, one of the creative directors at Jil Sander.
Today I read an interview by Giambattista Valli about the latest couture collection, which included men's cut models for the first time.
It would seem, what's the big deal? In 2021, this will not surprise anyone, but this is only if you are not familiar with the brand
Chic evening dresses of a world name have slightly moved under the onslaught of modern trends and were replaced by trouser suits—one more step towards genderless.
Above are a few looks from the Fall Couture 2021 collection by Giambattista Valli - expected and not so much😊
I have medium-length hair, rather long, and no matter how I like loose ones, mostly they are somewhere in the back and somehow ..
🤷🏼‍♀️ If you are like me, then you will find interesting eight ideas HOW and WHAT it is relevant to pin hair in 2021 according to 1
Low ponytail with bulky elastic
Low ponytail with a hair clip
There is nothing original in these two methods
The idea is that it is the low ponytail that is relevant😉
Headband with loose hair or with a ponytail
He returned😉
Bandana or scarf
This is a hit already a couple of years😉
Straw hat or Panama hat
If you are too lazy to comb your hair, and you are sure that you will not have to take off your hat😉
Big bow
Colored or black, maxi size is welcome anyway
Hairpins for locks near the eyes
We remove hair completely or leave the jumped strand
The point is not in their functionality but the decor.
I was getting ready all summer, but my hand didn’t rise And so..
I bought it
And I forgot how convenient it is!
It's no secret that in Europe bicycles are used not only as sports equipment but also as a means of transportation
And if in Italy there are urban cyclists🚲, but they rather stand out from the crowd, then in the Scandinavian countries, this rule works the opposite way.
And what always makes me happy is that a bicycle is not a reason to put on sweatpants and sneakers
In general, today is an inspiration for those who choose a bicycle🚲 or just a beautiful street style.
A classic shirt can certainly look stylish, but if you want a bit of variety, then:
✔️An elbow-length short-sleeved shirt - one of the most trending shirt options in 2021 - a masculine shirt with a relatively wide and short sleeve that almost reaches the elbow.
✔️Asymmetric clasp or any other unusual element
✔️ You can experiment a little with color and stop at calm, close to official- lavender, pale green, or at least pay attention to blue, pale pink, beige shades of shirts.
✔️ A slightly noticeable print can also become a feature
If a strip and a checkered print are already akin to the basis for a business style, then a print in the form of a repeating logo (this technique itself is very relevant in 2021) is already something unusual.
The tight-fitting catsuit, micro-trend of 2021, we saw it in summer collections, we also see it in autumn-winter ones
A catsuit is a straightforward manifestation of the skin-tight trend  and an alternative to oversize.
As such, catsuits looked on the podium -  it's understandable, but in real life? The most ardent fan is Kylie Jenner and her space choice with heels 🙈 or the leopard print
Haley Bieber in Saint Laurent looks much more sophisticated, and Gigi Hadid in Michael Kors is futuristic; this list does not end, let's inspired🦸‍ 
Leggings will continue to be a hit for fall🏆 They confirm and show us one of the macro trends of fall 2021 - the skin-tight trend.
Four trendy details will make ordinary leggings the very best:
Strips are a detail that always raises the most doubts, but I highly recommend trying it
Slits are often on the side or in the front, while it is better to choose the maximum length of leggings.
Leather texture
Color - we wear bright and colored options under skirts, dresses, bermuda shorts, and even cropped trousers
If the material allows, then the gathering effect is welcomed.
From that age when we can dress up as a pumpkin and win hearts, we all have grown up already, so I suggest looking for more original solutions for Halloween.
The Givenchy SS2022 show comes in handy, which about a month ago delighted us with luxury ideas for a Halloween party.
✔️prints and petrol canister bags
✔️basketball and pumpkin bag🎃 - two in one
✔️total black, makeup and hairstyle matching🧙‍♀️
Scary and merry Halloween, everyone! 😱😉
Outside the window we have a period of rain and slush
There is only one joy in it - rubber boots, which fashion brands have given special attention in recent seasons
Moreover, rubber shoes can be called the season's trend, regardless of weather conditions outside the window.
Bottega Veneta is definitely a trendsetter, and if you immediately presented their ugly green shoes, this is not the whole assortment; they have many, including basic colors.
In general, the trend is that rubber boots are becoming relevant👇🏼
✔️ when they have an incomprehensible, puffy, a little (or a lot) ugly shape or a massive tractor sole, like Prada at last winter's shows, crazy bright colors are welcome.
✔️ more basic, familiar to many, and relevant already many seasons - jockey motives
Here I would prefer basic colors, primarily black, while small blotches of color are possible.
❗️And don't forget the most straightforward and most trendy life hack for any rubber boots - socks sticking out from above - colored or "grandmother's" knitted.
# shoes2021
Today I will tell you about one of Autumn and Winter 2021-2022 - school aesthetics macro trends
This direction (like many others) goes in a circle, and now we see it returning to our daily life.
✔️ First of all, these are, of course, mini-skirts - the leader among the current silhouettes of skirts for 2021.
✔️ Collars straightened out of sweaters, sweatshirts - and here I'm not talking about big Victorian ones, but quite myself about the classic shirt collars that we button up and pull out from under the top layer, like exemplary pupils and students👧🏼👱🏼‍♀️👩🏼‍🏫
✔️ Check is the most school print
✔️ Sundresses with blouses
✔️ Pleating (perfect on mini-skirts and sundresses)
✔️ Lafers and other masculine shoes with socks.
It is recommended for implementation in wardrobes "absolutely everyone," regardless of involvement in the educational process!
Let's continue the theme of rubber boots with the spring show of Philosophy di Lorenzo Serafini with rubber boots in smears of paint (by the way, this is one of my favorite shows for this brand).
I tried to structure it a bit:
✔️Classic - with jeans
✔️with relaxed joggers and loose trousers
✔️with bermuda or extra long shorts
✔️with mini-skirts and lace shirts, with mini sundresses
✔️with shirt dresses
✔️with midi - dresses or skirts
✔️with tulle skirts, which in this form can be given a second life👌🏼
I recommend saving theese ideas, seriously, rubber boots were practically the only footwear that was used in this collection: out of 45 outfits, I counted 41 with rubber boots.
I am always very amused to read forecasts for trending colors for the upcoming season
The paradox is that the fashion industry is now so huge, and there are so many collections and designers that you can always find visual confirmation and justification among the latest collections no matter what forecast you make
There are, of course, such undisputed leaders as green last summer, but it is more the merit of influencers.
But it's always lovely and aesthetically pleasing to look at colorful collections anyway🧡 Today is the version of Vogue Italia.
🎨Electric Blue💙 (my personal favorite)
🎨Silver and Gold
🎨Lemon yellow
🎨Lavender / Lilac
🎨Milk chocolate
🎨Fuchsia
🎨Powder pink
🎨Fire red
🎨Well, and grassy green (there was not enough space for it in the pictures, but we already talked 
And a minute of modern fashion history😉 By the way, let this be the new heading 
We will talk about brand Totême, which appeared only seven years ago in 2014 and won the hearts of millions
The concept of the brand dawned on Elin Kling when she was evacuated from her home due to Hurricane Sandy
She had only 10 minutes to collect the necessary things, and then she realized that only simple but not dull things are needed in the wardrobe, which is flawlessly combined
So, the first Totême collection was a small capsule wardrobe
The idea fits perfectly into the celebration of sustainability, and the brand quickly earned incredible success 👌🏼
Enjoy one of the latest Totême campaigns - A Day in Stockholm to imbue with Scandinavian philosophy🧘‍♂️
A cozy selection of sweaters and cardigans from the streets, getting ready for warming😉
For warmer climates, cardigans and sweaters can become a full-fledged top layer, so choosing them is especially pleasant, because they will be at the very top👌🏼
Striped, cropped, voluminous and tight-fitting, in the color of the bottom and contrasting, draped over the shoulders, buttoned with one button, asymmetrically tucked in, and more ..
We continue the theme of sweaters and cardigans, or rather we take it more broadly - we are talking about knitwear.
Striped knitwear is perhaps the most relevant in color in the coming autumn-winter season
It can be a reasonably basic black and white stripe or a bright crazy alternative from a thousand colors, and the strip's width, frequency, and direction don't matter
Still, the most relevant will be a mix of different stripes (thin with thick, different colors, etc.)
A good blazer 👌🏼 occupies a special place in our wardrobe
For some, it can even become full-fledged outerwear
It is difficult for me to imagine a lifestyle where there would be no place and application for it
Briefly about the main trends of this fall:
🤍 White options look mainly aristocratic on cold days, so if you can wear them, then - GO, do it! For practicality, try to combine white blazers with a dark bottom; you don't have to settle for total color.
🤎Warm tones of beige and brown give us a cozy atmosphere, which is vital in autumn
The options range from pure classics like Fendi to outdoor Jacquemus.
🖤Any black will become the most trendy if you create a total black image with it.
💛 Of prints - the most autumnal and most relevant (autumn 2021 was no exception) - a check.
Let's continue about the fall 2021 blazers:
💖 The play of textures - from leather (Alberta Ferretti) and fleecy velvet (Paco Rabanne) to dazzling shine (Giorgio Armani), jacquard (Etro), and, of course, tweed (Chanel).
💙 There is no consensus, but I would stop at moderately oversized or direct, but free enough to experiment with layering, without it, after all, in autumn and winter there is nowhere
To become the top layer and the bottom with oversized silhouettes, it is also better not to overdo it.
💔 Well, the shoulders, broad and most pointed, by the way, are especially good with slightly fitted options (Dolce & Gabbana).
The modern aesthetics of comfort and convenience have long allowed us to change heels to flat running, loafers, ballet flats, sneakers, and even slippers (in the literal sense of the word) have taken over the world! 🌎 And I'm generally glad of this, and I changed my shoes myself a long time ago
In my wardrobe heels occupy 10% at most (or maybe less).
But how pleasant it is to look at an understandable combination of jeans + heels that many did not abandon them even in their "darkest" years😂
and I will still get the heels from the far shelf today! 😉
We continue yesterday's theme of heels with denim
A pair of jeans with a slit + heels is perfect
In principle, these jeans look great without heels, in general, I like this micro-trend.
In general, I recommend👍🏼 to consider - concisely and at the same time trendy👌🏼 How do you?
It seems that the panacea called HIGH BOOTS has gotten out of control this fall and winter, and the most current boots are not just high but incredibly high; they hide even under the mini.
👢 Preferred options are leather; suede, and fabric boots so far can be called morally obsolete.
👢 If we talk about the silhouette, then the boots in the Fall-Winter 2021 collections were very different, from reasonably loose to tight-fitting stockings.
👢 As for the sole, there was no consensus among the designers either
We met both a heel and a flat sole
The last options were both on a flat thin sole and the most massive one.
Styling boots, we strive for balance⚖️
✔️If the boots are tight-fitting or high-heeled, they require an element that will slightly dampen their excessive sexuality - skirts and dresses must have the length of the midi and maxi
Although, given the incredible high of the jackboot in 2021, there may be a mini
In any case, it is better if the skirt goes over the boots, overlapping the leg.
✔️If the boots are loose enough or on a flat/massive sole, they do not need a balancing element, and they can be perfectly combined with everything and even with a mini👌🏼
A little stylistic trick from the Balenciaga SS2022 show that we can apply now
In anticipation of the cold weather and enjoyable layering life hack☝🏼
Under the skirt and dress, including knitted, we wear trendy bulky jeans with wide legs.
It seems to be "a little too," but stylishly👌🏼 I will try! 😉
The MAXI approach is generally relevant in 2021 (and the upcoming 2022) in bags as never before, primarily for shoppers, totes, and hobos
Their size has grown so much that it is difficult to call it logical or convenient, although I am impressed by the idea of   a "second home" bag.
The texture of such bags is welcome (it makes them even more noticeable) 🆚 but at the same time, there is an opposite minimalist approach - absolutely smooth bags of maxi bags
Dense textiles are also highly esteemed as the primary material (here, the legislator, of course, is Dior with its legendary tote).
One of the most coveted boots🧡 of the last fall-winter season from the collaboration of GIA BORGHINI with Pernille Teisbaek continues their invasion this year
I'm sure you have seen them more than once, and perhaps you already have them (or their analogs)
If not, then it's time to think about purchasing😉
Comfort and modern aesthetics in one bottle🤍🤎
This Saturday morning, I want to ask: "How do you like the new trend for" tired of life" knitwear?"
claims it's cozy ☺️
Have a lovely weekend, everyone! 😘
One of the macro trends for fall-winter 2021 is rustic motifs
The quest for rustic authenticity is expressed first in the prints - floral in muted autumn shades
Most often used in dresses and blouses with frills or ruffles
But there is also an alternative solution for this year - outerwear with rustic prints
Best options from Acne Studios and Kenzo🌻🧡
I propose to introduce this trend into the wardrobe in dosage and be sure to balance it
Here are some options for how this one:
✔️ heavy shoes, massive heels or brutal soles,
✔️ denim,
✔️ bulk jersey
To be honest, I'm not a big fan of Demna Gvasalia and Balenciaga in general
And the point is not even in the very essence but in the frightening (for me) presentation and the chaos they create around them
But if we consider the collections in detail, then there is always something worthy🤩
This time Balenciaga SS2022, I was pleased with many large textured and very roomy bags 👜 
And the color palette is very diverse, with many deep and rich colors.
I have put together seven easy ways to style sweaters (Part 1):
Asymmetrically tuck into trousers/skirt (front or side) Be careful with thick and oversized sweaters
They can "give" unnecessary volume in the waist area.
Pull up the sweater sleeves - this can be done as high as possible (above the elbow)
I especially like it if, at the same time, we leave the bottom layer unassembled - a turtleneck, a shirt, etc.
Throw it over the shoulders - this technique looks very relaxed when we use it on another (the most similar sweater)
The sleeves can be tied together; asymmetry is welcomed - skip one edge under the armpit, not on the shoulder
By the way, the technique is also relevant for outerwear (trench coat, coat).
Don't try to wrap🙅🏼‍♀️ the collar of the sweater/turtleneck; on the contrary, we leave it carelessly gathered.
To be continued ..
Styling a sweater 😉 Part 2, you can find the beginning 5
Tuck hair into a stand-up collar, if its length allows.
Completely straighten the shirt from under the sweater (the sweater should be of a free silhouette and at least 10 cm longer than the sweater).
Straighten the shirt collar
The diligent schoolgirl effect fits perfectly into the macro trend of school aesthetics:
Let's save and experiment! 😉
🎄A little bit of Christmas mood from Totême.
Following the "doll" model, I attach a real full-size one, although the accuracy is the highest without it👌🏼
We have a new trend for anatomical tops, sweaters, and dresses
It, of course, was facilitated by Prada😍, and then Lanvin actively supported it.
Despite the fact that the idea was originally borrowed from a sports wardrobe, Lanvin's performance turned out to be very feminine - silk dresses with Greek draperies are beautiful💙, while Prada is incredibly stylish and wearable👌🏼
As the owner of modest volumes from above, I am generally pleased with the opportunity to emphasize them at least a little😂 Therefore,  I am already looking for something similar for myself.
We are thinking about anatomical tops and bodysuits (so to speak, for shaping😂), and Chiara Ferragni, meanwhile, acts literally👌🏼 — so as not to go unnoticed! 
And so it happened, of course, with Schiaparelli 😉
Since we are talking about Schiaparelli, I will put in a few words about how beautiful their latest collection SS2022 was
The surrealism that makes you fall in love at first sight, although if you look at it, then love only becomes stronger❤️‍🔥
In the collection, we see glasses with additional eyes on the temples, a medallion - a third ear, fingers on sandals, long nails, umbrella hats, and many options for accents on the chest.
Christmas🎄 showcases ..
Art, looking at which the heart sinks
And I know for sure that it is there that the New Year mood lives.
So far, I am sharing with you the best in Italy, but I look forward to snow so that I can walk along the central shopping streets of Milan and photograph this miracle with my frozen (well, let it) hands
Forecasters promise the first snow🤞🏼 at the end of the week.
Memories are the theme of the December of Vogue Italia, infinitely graceful and profound filming
This is precisely what we want in the pre-holiday magazine👏🏼
Let's keep in our memory only the best of this year🤍
Let's try to get away from the topic of Chanel's failure with its Advent calendar (everyone has already told about this) and look at their Métiers d'art collection objectively
An insane amount of semantic details make up a whole story that unites hundreds of European artisans.
🖤   I liked the subtle idea of   combining ancient craftsmanship with modern graffiti through logo embroidery.
🖤New of the silhouettes - elongated tweed jackets, in half unbuttoned state, create the effect of that very royal vibe.
🖤The most vital stylization that we can already safely use is a voluminous cardigan for a jacket🖤 (in general, cardigans in this collection are the best, in my opinion👍🏼) 
🖤Well, the abundance of accessories is what we love Chanel.
All interest here is definitely in the details
Let's concentrate on them😉
The return of Sex and the City is being discussed everywhere
There are so many polar opinions, the questions are so acute and exciting, and the arguments of the parties are so convincing that at different moments I want to join one or the other🙈
Therefore, let's better discuss what we are all here for😊 (this is me about the new style of heroines)
So, where did Sarah Jessica Parker appear at the premiere?
Of course, Oscar de la Renta (remember, her "failed" wedding?): сorset, tulle skirta (reference the first frames of the first part, where Carrie is spinning around herself, but pink tulle occupies only part of the skirt - a symbol of the past? 🤔), pink satin SJP Collection shoes (no, not Manolo), Erdem handbag (again, no,😊 not Fendi) and vintage jewelry.
The Zara Atelier coat collection is excellent 🖤 Incredible artistic vision combines design and craftsmanship.
Camel with roses ELIZA
Classic masculine silhouette and color combined with sequins on the collar and cuffs plus a beaded brooch.
Coat astrology YILAN
We see twelve zodiac signs, detachable blue fluffy collar, emerald green rhinestones, and sky blue lining.
Coat in the style of kimono AMAR
It has maximum contrast of embroidered colors on the black, perfect silhouette in its simplicity.
RAYNARA patchwork robe
Lurex, jacquard, detachable fur collar, painted lines, and trendy (thanks to Bottega and not only) robe silhouette.
Poncho Patchwork GRETA
Its features are floral ornament in oriental style and velvet appliques with delicate tassels along the edge.
Cocoon with CARA feathers
Shadows of contrasting blacks on jacquard, some sequins, and feathers are all belted with a black leather belt.
True couture from the mass market, no matter how ridiculous it sounds☺️
Pantone clearly showed us the main (in his estimates) color of the upcoming 2022 - Very Peri, a dynamic periwinkle blue hue with a vivifying violet-red undertone blend.
As for me, while bright electro blue💙 has more perspective than this shade, but, as they say, time will tell😉
We continue the purple and lavender theme from Pantone
Master class from 💜Lady Diana, who adored purple until December 2021
For a combination of red with violet❤️💜 not everyone will decide, but as it is beautiful, and I advise you to pay attention a little more calm purple with pink💜💗 
I don't pretend to be a beauty expert, but on the eve of the holidays and at your request, today I will tell you a little about makeup trends:
👁 Purple, blue, their shades in very different designs
👁 Arrows - from the classic to the most unusual, a notable trend will be colored outline and highly graphic options
I like the effect when the arrow doubles at the corners of the eyes
And even more, the arrows can only be from the bottom😉
👁 Accents on the eyes without (or with a minimum amount) of mascara - due to shadows, arrows, decor, while the eyelashes remain natural in length and color
👄 Bright shades and lip liner as a symbol of the 2000s are back with us
👩🏼Nude in all dimensions is still with us
We focus on the corners of the eyes, cheekbones, the area above the lip, the upper surface of the nose, and the chin.
✨Glitter is everywhere and everywhere (when, if not now - for the New Year)
On the eve of the new year🎄, we see so many sequins that it may be boring
 Therefore, we look at the opposite texture, but close to the mood with sequins
Velvet and velour are deep, saturated, slightly parade, and substantially warmer (necessary for the winter holiday) 😉 Dresses and costumes from velour will easily find applications not only on New Year's days but after when the Christmas tree is already taken out of the house.
For "high" purposes:👸🏼
Velvet + Golden Shoes
Velvet + Red Accessories
Velvet + crystals
For "to be pretty":💃🏻
Velvet + heavy shoes
Velvet + maxi bows
Color velvet performed mini
Oscar de la Renta continues to fall in love with himself by feeling the spirit of the times and the wind of change 💨 There are practically no princess dresses in the new Pre-Fall 2022 collection, or instead, there are princess dresses, but in a modern design.
Mini, bright colors, corsets, patchwork, transparency, lightness and ..
attention☝🏼 knitted shorts, "houndstooth" and sweaters 🤪
"Have you ever seen it something like this before?!" - will exclaim generation Y (to which I also belong directly and indirectly)
"This is for us!" - the already grown and flourished generation Z will rejoice.
😪 Those who are sad about Disney times have several options for you too😉 (latest photos😘).
Shooting for the December Vogue Italia with the speaking name - Psychedelia explodes my brain this morning Monday and makes it work.
In a very interesting stylization, Marni, Dior, Bottega, Loewe, Dolce & Gabbana, Undercover and not only lit up.
Everything is a beautiful week! 🎄 We have she's pre-Christmas, so promises to be saturated.
One of the most striking trends of winter 2022 - Shoes with colored soles🥾🟢🟡🔵🟣
I think that most of us know to whom we owe this - Bottega Veneta has given us more than one hot trend in recent years, including this one
This trend is often realized on Chelsea boots, but there are options for high boots and lace-up boots.
🟢 Options with a contrasting sole will be the most trendy.
🟤But if you are for more relaxed decisions, pay attention to shoes with contrast colors of the soles, but still not too much.
⚪️ The most "basic" will be a heavily textured sole (it seems to stand out, but not too much)
✔️ The most understandable way to style such shoes is to match some other detail to the color of the sole - it can be an accessory, a bag, or even outerwear.
✔️Another option is to leave maximum attention on the shoes and put together a total color outfit, where the sole will be the brightest accent.
Balmain in the face of Olivier Rousteing creates exclusive masterpieces not only for Zendaya, this time we admire the Claudia Schiffer🤍
Maxi-dress bustier is inlaid with pearls and black crystals with a clutch and incredibly stunning slingbacks.
By the way, I remind you that Olivier Rustin is only 36 years old, from which the steering wheel of Balmain is already 10
impressive, isn't it? And what does Claudia Schiffer look like in his 18 with a tail (tail in 33 years old) generally the topic for a separate conversation❤️
In the pre-Christmas hustle and bustle, I learned to make trendy colored arrows⤴️🔄↕️
A micro-master class is attached above 👆🏼 (suddenly, someone will come in handy)
Merry Christmas! 💫😘
💫👼🏻Merry Christmas, everyone!
A portion of ZARA's Christmas mood in an almost complete 40-minute film📽 - 
If you have a little bit of time on this Saturday day and you need to feel an impending miracle🤩, then I highly recommend watching.
Are there any Fendi baguette lovers among you? 🙋🏼‍♀️
Incredible exhibition in Rome "Hand in hand" by Fendi, where artisans from each region presented their version:
Liguria - silver threads
Trentino Alto Adige - peacock feather embroidery
Valle d'Aosta - hemp weaving
Piedmont - wool embroidery
Emilia Romagna - stone mosaic
Lombardy - baguette turned mini suitcase with drawers
Campania - carved from wood with graceful inlay
Lazio - jewelry technique granulate
Abruzzo - a lace miracle
Veneto - a jacquard story
Umbria - Medieval Italian print
Tuscany - seamless baguette is literally sculpted from leather
Puglia - weaving with a traditional Apulian technique
Marche - weaving from willow twigs
Molise - famous for Molisian lace
Calabria - weaving from ginestra fibers
Sardinia - weaving pibions
Basilicata - openwork embroidery on linen
Friuli Venezia Giulia - linen and cotton with alpine motifs
Sicily - silver, and coral
More details -  What kind of baguette did you want? 😉
If your friends offer to celebrate the New Year without pretentious outfits, but you really, really want ..
Take a transparent (although not necessarily transparent) dress and wear under it short leggings according to the Dior covenant - the degree of solemnity is reduced, and a beautiful dress is present😉
There was a lot of negativity on the net about Chanel's transforming boots (I am far from being their devoted fan), but☝🏼 Jil Sander, with her Pre Fall, 2022 collection, made me look at Chanel boots from the other side...
It looks like a new micro-trend - elasticated shoes
First of all, boots, but Jill Sander went further, and we also saw shoes
By the way, you won't surprise anyone with ballet flats on an elastic band.
It looks like next fall there will be a topical old new joke - about an elastic band from boots😉
What can turn a casual shirt/blouse into a festive one (but not too much)?
✨ glossy texture - silk, satin, and their analogs
✨ fancy print (while we choose the most classic silhouette, all the emphasis is on the pattern)
✨ bow (from mini to maxi)
✨ collar (the larger and more unusual - the better)
✨ sleeves (puffs, cylinders, and something like that)
✨ lace (only without fitting)
We look into our closet; perhaps there is already the perfect holiday blouse? 😉
And in the meantime, I remind you of the inevitable approach of New Year's Eve✨ And I do it with pleasure by directly immersing myself in New Year's dances
FROLOV collections are always incredible💔 But on the eve of the holiday, I want them especially ...
Happy New Year! 🎄 Thank you for every post you read, for your questions, your comments, and your likes❤️ Only the best awaits us ahead 😘
In the meantime, I wish your New Year's table to look like this💍
Buon anno! Tanti auguri! 🎆
Happy New Year, everyone! 🍾🎄
 January 1 is the time of pleasant results for the past 2021:
✔️ we have grown 3.5 times;
✔️ the citation index of the In Voga channel is about 50 points;
✔️ more than 7,000 views of the channel's posts daily.
Thank you for such impressive results and figures😘
See you tomorrow! It will only get more interesting from now on! 😉
Is there a particular mood for a NY sweater this year? If yes, then let it be plain red❤️ and not with a deer (!!!) 🦌
My love to red ❤️ + chocolate🤎
It seems absolutely all influencers are obsessed with headbands😍 The undisputed leaders among brands are Prada, Fendi, Simone Rocha, but the rest are quickly catching up.
Unambiguously like from me👍🏼 Today there is a new street style
Let's inspire ❤️
Knee-highs, knee-highs, knee-highs..
We have seen them at almost every show in Fall 2021, Spring 2022, and I guess there will only be more of them in Fall 2022.
I suggest taking a batch -  they will come in handy in the spring
And now you can use it for warmth
👍🏼 Well, we are inspired by the fashion shows for a successful stylization.
What everyone needs (regardless of age, body size, preferences) is a basic coat
And the January sales are the best time to watch or update this
For inspiration, I suggest looking at , a London influencer with Indian roots.
Her wardrobe is laconic and an excellent example of a basic one
By the way, despite her 1.3 million subscribers, she doesn't pass by the mass-market, which does not prevent her from looking 5 out of 5 🌟
Perhaps, at the level of popularity of the 2000s, only anime in all forms and variations have recently been released, so Loewe x Spirited Away has released a capsule collection based on Spirited Away, remember it was like that in 2001 😉
How do you feel about cartoon prints?
I've heard many different opinions about the over-blazer🤷🏼‍♀️ Not that I want to convince those who reject it, but still look how different it can be: from the relaxed playful by Chiara Totire and the most masculine by Kaia Gerber to the incredibly feminine and sophisticated in total white by Pernille Teisbaek.
Yesterday, Kate Middleton turned 40, a selection of her iconic images on this occasion
The last two photos are official photo-portraits by Paolo Roversi in dresses by Alexander McQueen❤️
Classics, sophistication, elegance.
If, as an alternative to your favorite comfortable jeans and trousers, you are ready for skirts, then in winter, the best pair for them is a sweater🧡
Here are some ideas:
Total color (according to the classics - beige, white or black, for the brave - bright mud)
Midi on a high waist + tucked in a sweater, "and legs have doubled" 😉
Asymmetry on a skirt or sweater (can be partially tucked in or off the shoulder)
Satin + knitted sweater - the perfect play of textures
If you really want a balaclava that is "closed at all," but the aura of a criminal mask confuses it, order the most largest knitting from your beloved grandmother🧶 Well, it turns out stylish mi-mi-mi🧸
For comparison, I attached a few photos of smooth and textured balaclava
Feel the difference.
Let's go through the most relevant cardigans in 2022, something has lingered with us since last year, but there are also brand new leaders:
Cardigan with fur collar
Hi from  2000
Colors are also appropriate; pink Barbies are among the leaders.
Cardigan with ethnic prints
This is a dense, elongated cardigan, often in bright colors and fringe
Interestingly -  there is a prospect that this coming summer we will wear it on a swimsuit😉
Micro cardigan with chain or clasp
Jacquemus is not inferior to the position😉
Shortened very bulky knit
Length to the waist, no more to ruin the proportions.
Maxi models
For those who prefer elegance.
It seems that my terrible nightmare has come true ..
😱Valentino revived those very shoes from the 2000s - tasteless (at least in my opinion) on a horse platform and heels ...
In the performance of Versace, they are at least made of satin and with a square cape - these two details make them even cute and doll-like🧸 But Valentino is completely past for me🙅🏼‍♀️🎯
How do you like it?
It's time to take the Christmas tree out the door, the last fireworks have died down, and if you bought sequins for the New Year's holiday, meanwhile, I remind you that you shouldn't "push" them to the far shelf
We stylize in everyday life and cheer up ourselves and those around us:
The primary and foremost goal is to "calm" the shine, so cozy sweaters, knitwear, plain cotton are ideal neighbors of brilliance!
So, the perfect👌🏼 pair for sequins, be it a skirt, pants, or dress:
And also - flat shoes (Chelsea, Army soles) massive soles, and for a warmer season - sneakers, slip-on, or brogues with socks 👌🏼
The Prada mood
Prada, in the new campaign, briefly walked through the trends of the upcoming spring:
Well, their iconic tails on skirts from the SS 2022 show, of course, also lit up.
Stubborn sheep🐑 seriously and for a long time made their way to our wardrobes:
You won't remember everything at once🤔In any case, don't pass by this soft winter 2022 trend.
"Oh My God!" - It's not a clip, but an actual short film from Adele❤️ And a particular pleasure is, of course, her outfits thought out to the smallest detail, three couture splendors:
Vintage polka dot blouse with a slightly modified 50s aesthetic over a black sweetheart neckline corset + empire maxi skirt
Harris Reed
Golden dress with a white cape
An obvious parallel with the "divine" title of the video: golden brocade, a cape with a characteristic decor, and earrings with crosses.
Louis Vuitton
Ruby satin dress with tulle bolero
Inspired by the history and royal attire of the so XVIII century❤️
Vivienne Westwood
It's not a secret that luxury brands have long turned towards Asia, so the Chinese New Year🐉 is a particular reason for creating new limited collections and promos
Gucci decided to act literally (which, by the way, in my opinion, actually works better in the Asian market) and released the Gucci Tiger capsule🐅
Designed by Vittorio Accornero, the creator of the Gucci Flora print, the tiger is gracefully hidden in foliage and flowers, all painted in pastel colors
And, of course, we have in front of us exclusively manual work🙌🏼
Keep the mood of relaxation😊
I adore the Prada Fall 2022 Menswear new collection
The most memorable for me was the silhouette of X, which can be traced in them everywhere and everywhere.
A bit of theory🤓 It so happened that historically our beloved men were "assigned" an H-shaped silhouette, i.e., without bright accents on the shoulders, waist, or hips
Over time, they also began to recognize the V-silhouette, emphasizing the shoulders
BUT! ☝🏼 Before our eyes, stereotypes are being destroyed, and men are actively offered the X-silhouette, which was previously considered the sexiest and most feminine (remember New look Dior).
At Prada, we see numerous accents on the male waist: drawstrings tightened belts, wraps, and tucks
All this is supported and exaggerated by deliberately wide shoulders and additional accents on the sleeves, with which the waist seems even more defined.
And most importantly🤩 Well, who's to say that performed by Prada it looks FI-how unmanly? No indeed! Never before has a "feminine" X looked so masculine!
Bottega Veneta didn't pass by the Chinese New Year either😉 And with its characteristic scope, it presented an installation on the Great Wall of China - the name, brand logo and 新春 快乐, which means: "Happy New Year!" Plus, the brand took the initiative to make donations for the restoration of part of the Great Wall of China👍🏼
Well, and an orange capsule, of course, in addition😉 We don't see a literal quotation of the "tiger" (like Gucci) here, just our favorite bag, shoes, sunglasses and not only in orange version 🧡
Are there orange lovers among us? 😉
Wow, what a cute accessory Etro offers us in the new Fall Menswear 2022 collection😍
🤔 Either a warming belt for the lower back, a detachable stand-up collar, or an additional layer for multi-layer outfits - in general, the little thing is multifunctional and very entertaining.
But in general, the collection delights with its variety of textures - from silk men's blouses to velvet kimonos, from corduroy trousers to patent raincoats💔
A little bit of the 2000s in the feed from the upcoming spring and summer 2022 shows SS 2022 - mini, glitter, platform, low rise, bra-tops, lace, fur and feathers, denim, leopard.
Spring is coming
Are you already mentally prepared for this?😉
In the Fall 2022 Menswear collection, Fendi once again reminded us that pearls are no longer a female prerogative: neat pendants, beads, earrings, decor on bags, brooches - all this is very organic on men.
A game of contrasts that only adds masculinity 👌🏼💪🏼 In 2022 we are not shy about sharing pearls with our beloved men😉
And some Milan street style from last Men's Fashion Week, etc
fashion week was for men, then we'll talk about men:
✔️Bombers: from masculine leather to silk and cozy knits
✔️Lots of knitwear
✔️Wide trousers
✔️Orange color
✔️Ugly shoes
And endless relaxation🧘‍♂️ and eclecticism.
In winter, the "cabbage" story of layering is essential ☝🏼 And the first assistant for warming is a turtleneck, this is a kind of alternative to your favorite ❤️ white T-shirt.
And today, I have collected some visual application ideas:
🧷under the shirt (favorite classic)
🧷the bottom layer under the dress/sundress (we extend the life of dresses for the winter)
🧷 with a knitted vest (we play on the similarity of textures)
🧷 under a hoodie/sweatshirt (maximum degree of comfort and warmth)
🧷 with a festive top/blouse (we lower the degree of solemnity of the latter for daily use)
🧷on a leather shirt/dress/jacket (playing on the differences in textures).
The outdoor trend has captured our heads, bodies, legs, arms - well, in general, you understand.😉 And today, here are a few words about anorak (a jacket with a zipper on top, which is worn over the head, most often, but not necessarily with a large front pocket and hood).
I was a big fan 😍 of these jackets for many years before the outdoor fashion, but earlier I used them more for their intended purpose - for sports purposes
Hurrah, the boundaries are expanded, and with what indescribable pleasure this year I wear anoraks in the city❤️ Only they give an infinitely comfortable effect of a kangaroo 🦘
Let's inspire by the spring-summer 2022 shows from Lacoste, MSGM, TOD'S, where anoraks lengthen and almost turn into dresses.
The mini-skirt this spring will not only continue to be relevant, but it will also become a hit, so it's time to think about how you will fit it into your wardrobe
As always, we take the "help of a friend" from the last century😉
The 60s and Twiggy fashion - A-line mini-skirt with:
Dior, Courreges
The 90s and absolute sexy Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell - mini-skirt with:
2000's and Britney Spears' madness - low rise mini-skirt with:
Miu Miu, Coperni, Missoni, Blumarine, Fendace
Do you like endlessly wide and voluminous but hot and cozy down jackets? Many are afraid that they will absorb them and make them formless
Fears are not groundless
Here are a few recommendations on how to avoid this:
✅shoes with an elongated toe, a square toe will work against us here
✅massive and contrasting by color shoes
✅straight trousers/jeans (we avoid palazzo and wide trendy ones)
✅waistband
✅use unbuttoned as a top layer, for example, on puffy vests
✅structured bags in color different from the primary color of the down jacket
✅mega-voluminous scarf, against which the down jacket will seem like grace itself
A little bit of couture in the feed😍 And let's start with Schiaparelli Haute Couture spring-summer 2022 - for the first time on the catwalk after the break and, as always, with stunning surrealism that we want to look at endlessly.
And here are the main themes of the collection:
Catholicism and pagan priestesses
We see black and white gamma, a lot of gold, crosses, embroidery, and inserts of precious stones.
Astrology
The geometry of constellations and planets
Flowers
Traditional bouquets were replaced with palm trees, bird feathers, and petals.
Barbie style from Emili Sindlev & Valentino
Formula: miniskirt, micro-top, platform heels, bubblegum bag, messy bun, a couple of strands around the eyes, big rings in the ears and..
unexpectedly oversized jacket with patch pockets💗 Given the presence of the latter and cozy tweed texture - I like it👍🏼
A couple of years ago, we discussed how to properly mix jewelry, what tricks for a pair of gold and silver, what jewelry characters do not go well together, and what you can easily experiment with.
Today everything is simple - THERE ARE NO RULES🙅🏼‍♀️, the term "neck mess" has spread far beyond the neckline, the same rule, or rather the absence of rules, also works for rings, bracelets, earrings.
Thick with thin, long with short, golden with silver, refined with coarse, infantile with classic - the more unexpected, the better
By the way, the same principle works for men, too😉
An ideal situation for the morning, when you are not very awake yet, but in a hurry - we grab everything that comes to hand and goes ahead👌🏼
The number of feathers in the Chanel Spring 2022 Couture collection (usually not characteristic of them) once again confirms that in 2022 we will all be wearing feathers 🦚
There were also many fitted jackets and 3/4 sleeves, like Dior
 It looks like oversized jackets will meet serious competition in 2022.
In the meantime, we are summing up the Fall 2022 Men's Shows street style, and here are the brightest trends👌🏼 Taking into account the trend of genderless, all of the following will be relevant for both sexes, so read carefully☝🏼
Military - camouflage, khaki, and cargo
Fur (non-natural or vintage): hats, collars, fur coats
Bare tummy (hello from the 2000s)
Total black
Fantasy bags: ducks, monkeys, musical instruments, buckets of paint, and more
Forester look: plaid flannel shirt + jeans and you're done👌🏼
Loafers with socks
Total "orange"
Flared trousers from the 70s
Skirt over trousers
Let's save and try!
If you want the most trendy bomber, then look in the direction of masculine👌🏼
Large volume, rough material, patch pockets, dark colors, slight untidiness - we use all this at once or in parts🖤
We have already seen baseball caps with headscarves, but panama hats with scarves are something new😊 Parisian streetstyle never ceases to amaze😉
And, by the way, it will look more organic on men, and even better on such as in the photo, with bristles - natural masculinity plays with grandmother's🧕🏼 handkerchief👌🏼
And Chiara Ferragni continues to focus on the female breast, doing it, of course, with the help of Schiaparelli😉
I became interested in more detail, and that's where the legs come from - the Free the Nipple movement, which stands for equality and freedom, including in the form of objectification of female nipples
Schiaparelli has long been playing with public morality, imitating the outlines of the female breast.
For those who missed it, you can return to her previous acts of Chiara Ferragni in support of the Free the Nipple movement 
The fur hat itself is the hottest (literally and figuratively) trend of winter 2022 hats, but  I’ll tell you about the most popular models:
☝🏼 fur panamas
✔️the most colorful buckets from Emma Brewin -  Rihanna, Bella Hadid, and many other celebrities have been repeatedly seen in them, the fields of such a panama are absurdly large and voluminous, and it looks like a fungus🍄
✔️ also have more concise options - Ruslan Baginskiy, Acne Studios, Anna Sui, slightly shorter margins, and various textures - velveteen, fur, sheepskin.
Styling options:
-we continue the playful theme with bright socks and miniskirts
Spring is just around the corner (at least we sincerely believe it🤞🏼), and one of the most common questions I get asked during this warming period is "What's with leather jackets?"🤔
I answer:
Judging by the Parisian street style at the Haute Couture Week, the essential detail of the end of this winter and the upcoming spring is a colorful bright bag👜
Taking into account the fact that her “neighbors” most often still have basic colors, she looks stunningly accented 🤪
☝🏼Actual for both women and men.
We continue the theme of fur hats
A couple of days ago, we talked about panama hats, and today we will hit the classics: retro earflaps or classical forms.
The most uncomplicated advice is to look for inspiration from our parents👨‍👩‍👧‍👧 By the way, we also try to look for hats from them, suddenly we saved them😉
Welcome to the METAfashion world “ on the In Voga channel by 
As one of the most dynamic areas, fashion reacts most quickly to changes that take place in society
And the fashion METAverse🌐 is the first thing that awaits us in the new virtual world
In general, fashion is already ready for such changes - virtual models, virtual collections, virtual shows - all this has become normal for us over the past two years along with the rise of Web 3.0 technologies
But the fashion meta-universe won't stop there
And that is why I decided to follow this area in a little more detail and share the most interesting with you.
Now you know the reason why the  column was born
Daily fashion news about META, crypto, NFT and how global fashion brands are going digital.
NFTs are non-fungible tokens (or, more simply, unique digital assets based on blockchain technology), perhaps the most fashionable (literally and figuratively) trend of the virtual world today, so that we will start with it.
Gucci and Superplastic released collectible designer NFT toys a couple of weeks ago
Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele had a hand in their creation
In total, about 250 non-fungible tokens have been obtained, which can already be purchased on the 🎁A little bonus, for those who are not yet ready to completely move into the virtual space - along with NFT, buyers will also receive a physical original of the toy by post🧸
Wow, what a bright, sunny, cheerful, laid-back 🧡💛💚❤️ street style in Copenhagen - incredibly positive and life-affirming
Perfect for Friday night mood!
We see cargo (especially with heels), bright accessories, bombers, total print.
Have a great weekend everyone!😘
Well, after Rihanna in the first official pregnancy photo and Jennifer Lopez for the New York Times, we're all running after pink down jackets, right? In the spring, I just want something like that😉 
And a fascinating video from Zara about the approaching Valentine's Day
By the way, Zara has a good "love" collection in scarlet color.😉
Love❤️ can be found everywhere, although no, not to be seen, but to create with your own hands 👐🏼
Happy Valentine's Day!
Maisie Wielen has been designing the METAverse🌐 long before it was mainstream, so she's almost always one step ahead in this regard.
At the fashion week in New York, instead of models, two-meter holograms appeared on the catwalk, the Yahoo service was responsible for the technical side of the issue
The show could also be viewed at home on the WebAR platform by simply scanning a QR code.
Well, in addition to the innovative presentation, Maisie Wilen showed an excellent collection - lacquered trench coats🧡, printed catsuit, tight-fitting jersey and flared trousers with sequins - everything fits perfectly into the aesthetics of 2022👌🏼
A little reminder that personal style stays with us no matter the situation😉
Rihanna🖤 and Rosie Huntington🤎 The latter, by the way, gave birth two weeks ago to a baby named Isabella James.
Emily Ratajkowski in a faded Prada leather jacket confirms everything we talked about when discussing Lovely, simply lovely💔
Sports with a virtual face
Sports brands have headed for the METAverse:
🌐First in November last year, Adidas entered into a partnership agreement with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, after which they immediately hinted at the creation of a metaverse with The Sandbox
🌐After that, Nike announced the purchase of the NFT studio RTFKT, which creates collectible items for the metaverse
Both of them say that the main task now is to expand the digital presence☝🏼
Looks like we'll be doing abs sitting on the couch soon 😂
My association with spring is a relaxed pantsuit in crazy bright colors🔴🟠🟡🟢🔵🟣
 As soon as they start to appear on the streets, I think: "It seems to smell like spring!"
What are your associations with spring?🤔
A new summer collection of Ballroom on Mars on black sand and in volcanic landscapes  - this is a few Martian motifs from The Attico.
Evening dresses, sequins, and a seductive mesh with oversized shirts, cargo, and crochet - well, it is a Martian mixture! We see incredible headwear made of feathers and beads💙 and favorite sculpted heels on par with brand new lace-up toe sandals that reach the waist😊
And here are the first covers of fashion magazines dedicated to digital technologies - Metaverse by L'Officiel Ukraine🌐
Do you remember a couple of years ago, everyone was crazy about checkered (and plain) woolen shirts? 🤪 In the spring of 2022, we choose a fleece shirt.
The fleece texture is relevant this year in almost any manifestation, but the shirt cut (buttons, collar, patch pockets) is a unique chic👌🏼
We are already used to plain joggers and felt charmed 👌🏼 and chic in them, we also love knitted sportswear💗 and wear it so often that outstretched knees give us out 🙈 But it's too early to dwell on this, sweatpants from the 2000s are returning:
I'm looking for archival photos of Paris Hilton for inspiration😉
Ready for this trend?
My favorite classic jeans Levi's iconic 501 now in digital version.
Digital🌐  clothing is the future!😉
Swedish street style, unlike  is concise and minimalistic, although it would seem..
neighbors, the difference is noticeable
Basic coats, masculine bombers, knitwear, vintage furs, and sheepskin coats, from the bright ones, perhaps, only accessories are found - in the face of scarves, hats, and gloves
And I also note that nowhere, as in Stockholm, the iconic fur high boots and the Miu Miu bonnet don't look harmonious
And I believe that they are needed there😉
And, as if resisting the general minimalism of the Swedish environment, Stand Studio impresses with the colors and texture of its Fall 2022 collection🤩The brand's DNA is bright fur (exclusively NOT natural), leather in all its manifestations and prints, of course.
Winter 2022/2023 collection is as cheerful😆 and stylish as expected
By the way, knee-high fluffy boots (it's clear that the idea was borrowed from Miu Miu) are the central detail of every second outfit.
I'm glad that despite the worldwide love and recognition, Stand Studio has a reasonably affordable pricing policy, so you can decorate your wardrobe without having to sell an apartment😂 - 
I opened the season of Milan street style 🧡
Diesel Fall 2022
We see many denim, leather, including colored, cargo pants with heels, cropped shirts, and low rises.
Photo from the personal archive of In Voga.
About a week ago I recommended a colored trouser suit for spring if you bought or you already had one and want to wear it now, then here's an excellent example of how to wear it with boots and boots.😉 However, this is true not only for colored but also for any pantsuit.
And the pants are clean, and the degree of style is on top👌🏼
Entertainment Weekly's new digital cover is Catwoman🐈‍⬛ Zoë Kravitz and the new Batman🦹 Robert Pattinson
The fact that brown is the new pink after Jacquemus'  post on Instagram did not joke, only the lazy one😊 Here is a little chocolate🍫 mood from me for today.
Fresh selection of skinny jeans looks👖, and one more reminder:
☝🏼 that they are back
✌🏼 that for the beginning of spring, no one has come up with anything more convenient😆
At the shows of autumn-winter 2022/2023, a trend for fur that imitates natural fur(similar to the degree of confusion) clearly emerges
It turns out such a la vintage
Hence the silhouettes of fur coats and fur coats of our mothers and grandmothers🧑🏼‍🦳👵🏼
Interestingly, this trend went from street style to the catwalk, and not vice versa, because this winter we have already seen it on the streets of our cities.😉 Well, as it should be in the modern world, the trend is absolutely agender - both girls and men wear it.
I confirm with yesterday's Michael Kors Fall 2022 show, as well as Dolce & Gabbana Fall 2022 Menswear, Egonlab Fall 2022 Menswear, Sulvam Men's Fall 2022, and the streets😊
Mango in the  clearly showed why there are 2 identical (well, or very similar) shirts in the wardrobe:
I really like it💙 Such a perfect relaxation is obtained!
Not everyone needs a pleated mini from Miu Miu, especially since there are so many of them everywhere and everywhere that very soon, instead of adoration, the opposite effect will appear🤷🏼‍♀️ But the very idea of   a pleated mini skirt is 👍🏼eternal, and more than ever 👌🏼relevant.
Styling options:
✔️total preppy - knee socks, loafers, ties and white shirts, knitted vests, sweatshirts, panama hats
✔️ play with femininity - neat heels, shirt with frills and ruffles, tweed jackets
✔️ balance masculinity - oversized jackets, combat boots, rough leather
✔️ sports notes - sneakers, white socks, baseball caps, bombers, and parkas
What do you prefer?😉
Crocheted catsuit is just an explosion💣 of imagination, incredible improbability from Acne Studio❤️
Platform sandals and a bag are my ultimate dream for summer 2022☺️
Polo dresses - in rhinestones, scarlet silk boxer shorts as an alternative to minis, sports socks like sexy stockings, bomber jackets and polo with rose-shaped embroidery, and sports gloves of all kinds and types instead of evening ones.
An impressive mix of sport with frankness and sexuality from David Koma Fall 2022
A very beautiful stylization of a midi and maxi length dress with trousers was at the By Malene Birger Fall 2022 show - for those who can't stand tights😂 But seriously, it's incredibly stylish, a very suitable solution for not too warm, but already spring March.
March is the time of rubber boots, and it remains to be glad that they are now at the peak of their popularity, even where there were no rain puddles
But still, let's be inspired by those who know a lot about rain and damp - streestyle from fashion week in Copenhagen.
We have three most relevant options:
☝🏼 Low puffy a-la galoshes Bottega Veneta
✌🏼 With a rubberized nose in an outdoor aesthetic
☝🏼✌🏼High rubber "pipes" knee-deep
Let's talk about makeup today
Remember, before the New Year, they spoke to you ? Before warming (as it should be😁), they became a little lighter and airier due to..
white color.
So, white arrows - this trend was presented to us by Dior at its SS 2022 show, which was readily picked up by beauty influencers
😉 It all started with arrows on the lower eyelid
Still, now it doesn't matter anymore - you can draw on the upper eyelid as well.
I think in the summer it will disperse and grow, you can start training😊
Let's move on for a moment to New York Fashion Week, which was about a month ago, or rather, to the Carolina Herrera Fall 2022 show
And even though the collection is next winter, it turned out so light and spring that today is the best day to consider it in more detail.
A lot of tulles, X-shaped silhouettes (the most feminine and sexy), puffed sleeves, embroidery with sequins and stones, capes, floral prints, bows, and ribbons, and it could not have done without a catsuit.
And it doesn’t matter what is in front of us - a neckline to the navel or a tightly buttoned shirt looks equally attractive, it’s not at all vulgar and not boring
And this skirt with a train on the trousers of the pipe is incredible❤️ I applaud 👏🏼
Happy International Women's Day!🌷
New Balenciaga campaign with virtual models in METAverse
A universe with red carpets, lots of black colors, leather, oversized and ugly shoes.
A beauty trend that awaits us in spring and summer - rhinestone freckles 😊 Mostly, of course, we saw them at couture shows, but I'm sure that they will take root in everyday life - with a white T-shirt, jeans and ballet flats or even sneakers, such a make-up will look even better👍🏼
Let's save and repeat👌🏼 
How many women's-style ties were at Louis Vuitton Fall 2022👔 Almost all of them were paired with dress shirts, but the masculine character was softened by:
Do you use ties in your wardrobe?
The first digital fashion week starts on March 24 in the metaverse on the  where dozens of global brands will take part
Entrance is completely free
Each user will be able to attend shows, parties and exhibitions
But to dress your avatar in the digital clothes that were just shown on the catwalk, you will have to pay.
We are almost used to the elastic band from underpants and skirts, but Miu Miu in the Fall 2022 collection went further - now we tuck T-shirts, shirts, and even sweaters into these underpants🙈 A new way of styling, so to speak.
The double belt and rough, worn skin also attract attention.
Fast forward to distant Hawaii and take a closer look at Le splash Jacquemus SS 2022
I suggest concentrating on styling details and accessories that you can and should consider:
A new way to wear glasses - on the arms and legs
Unpaired gloves, and a lot of gloves in general
Towel on the hips
Double trouser legs
"Swimming" sunglasses
Bags - air mattresses
Shoulder bags
Harnesses in the most diverse designs
From what we have already seen, Jacquemus supported the Vichy plaid trends, swimsuits over clothes, numerous nets, orange color.
Did you know that back in 2019, Nike patented the CryptoKicks sneaker authentication system? When buying a pair of shoes, an NFT is generated
Such a token contains the entire “pedigree” of sneakers: data about the manufacturer, appearance and special parameters, information about resales.
The actual launch of the system has not happened yet, but given the development of the industry, it is possible that our sneakers will receive passports very soon😉
And Schiaparelli Fall 2022, as always, is in the details, and this time the main action took place literally on the heads, although ..
the rest of the body did not remain offended either.
And by the way, if we are talking about Schiaparelli, just the other day a new video for the song Sweetest Pie was released, where Dua Lipa, in the form of a siren luring men into her surreal reality, tried on Schiaparelli couture🖤
I reviewed the Jil Sander Fall 2022 collection
Based on the experience of past years I am sure that it will be taken apart for details, what you should pay attention to:
Very expressive styling at the Hermes Fall 2022 show gives us the right to no longer comb, or rather comb our hair in the opposite direction😉
Another way to get one of the most coveted fashion accessories at a reasonable price is the METABirkin bag
The new NFT MetaBirkin is the creation of Los Angeles-based digital artist Mason Rothschild and part of a project at Art Basel Miami.
But it was not without scandal
NFT OpenSea had already removed MetaBirkins from its online platform in response to Hermès' cease and desist letter
Rothschild continued to sell them on his website, linking visitors to other exchanges where they remain available for purchase and sale.
Litigation has already begun on this issue
Fashion VS Art
Lively and positive backstage from Jacquemus SS 2022, where you can see almost more than the show itself
More details about the show were discussed a few days ago 
Curly cutouts on the visors of caps and baseball caps, hat brim and other headwear are definitely the trend of the next autumn and winter
Botter in the Fall 2022 collection joined the previously discussed Raf Simons, Richard Quinn.
Wow!!! 🤩 Lacoste made a collaboration with Minecraft.
Recently, a new Lacoste collection with elements of the cult game Minecraft was presented, and Minecraft, in turn, offers 30 mini-games with skins from Lacoste - Croco Island.
The collection is already available for purchase on the  and the virtual universe is already happy to meet gamers for free.
5 ways to modernize your boring Burberry SS2022 trench coat:
Is there anyone who wants to try it?😊
A "talking" screensaver at Alexander McQueen Fall 2022 show, piles of mulch, peat smell, birds chirping, and insect sounds awaited guests before being shown the collection at a warehouse in Brooklyn, New York
And the main theme of the collection is mycelium.
In the center of the collection there is bright mushroom embroidery and silk fringe, protruding knitted threads, which just imitated mycelium
But there were also less conceptual and more brand-specific rough leather, taffeta, blurry prints, X-shaped silhouettes.
The first digital vintage collection Own Your Denim by Soorty in collaboration with Left Hand Twill (a retailer that specializes in vintage clothing).
The Own Your Denim collection consists of 10 physical items and their digital version
The virtual garments are featured in clips inspired by 70s cinematography that reference clothing's connection to American culture
I propose to plunge into the atmosphere and walk along the streets of Hollywood with a pair of jeans.
In spring, you want colored denim more than ever.🧡💗💛💜💚💙 
In 2022, of course, orange is in the lead, pink, purple, and yellow are not far behind, green has not completely cooled down since last year, and numerous divorces and blurs are also welcome.
Knife edge play 🃏 from Chanel Fall 2022 - ribbed wool stockings with sandals and pumps.
How do you like pink wool heels with slingbacks?
From March 24 to March 26, the first fashion week (MVFW) was held at the 
Unlike offline events, virtual fashion week was available to everyone, and entrance tickets or passes were not required
It was enough to come to the Fashion District and follow what was happening.
“We do this to show the community and other brands, ‘Hey, Decentraland is a place for shopping
Everyone is wearing cool clothes, and brands can release on the platform.’ It’s a way of bringing more people to the platform and making it more compelling for users,” - says Sam Hamilton, creative director at Decentraland Foundation.
Over the past year, many brands have released NFT collections and held events in the metaverse
Seemingly a niche market for geeks, virtual spaces have attracted the attention of key figures such as Gucci, Balenciaga, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana
In the coming days, I will tell and show you in more detail who joined them.
Let's start with the Dolce & Gabbana show, the models on it were avatars with the head of cats
By the way, despite the trend of being agender, they had a gender😁 And let's talk about trends, of course, although they are virtual, they are still traceable and even more than that - there are some parallels with real collections that we have seen recently.
What outfit would you dress your avatar in?
Of course, we will not pass by Oscar today either
And here are my TOP 10 favorite outfits from the ceremony.
Demi Singleton in Miu Miu, gioielli Messika
Caitriona Balfe in Louis Vuitton
Zoë Kravitz in Saint Laurent
Maggie Gyllenhaal in Schiaparelli
Jada Pinkett-Smith in Jean Paul Gaultier Couture
Zendaya in Valentino Haute Couture, Bulgari
Alana Haim in Louis Vuitton
Liya Kebede in Alaia
Jessica Chastain in Gucci
Nicole Kidman in Armani Prive
Do you already have your favorites?💗
Suddenly, you, like me, thought about how beautifully the beret will fit into your wardrobe💙
Here are some recommendations:
In addition, to cringe sausages/balloons, car dresses, lip stories, the Loewe Fall 2022 show also featured leather dresses frozen in motion, made in the same technique as the already legendary Zendaya dress
Sits like a glove 👌🏼 - literally and figuratively.
Well, for those who have not yet had time to consider, those very crazy options from the Loewe Fall 2022 show that I spoke about above are also attached👆🏼
Philipp Plein is arguably the most famous🥇 designer in the digital🌐 fashion world
A few facts about him:
☝🏼He is the first designer to officially purchase land in the Decentraland meta-universe for $1.4 million and build the vast Plein Plaza complex there
And this skyscraper is located right at the point where users first enter the metaverse.
✌🏼He was the first to start accepting payment for his physical collections for cryptocurrency in August 2021.
☝🏼✌🏼Philipp Plein and 3D artist Antoni Tudisco have teamed up with 21st-century auction house Portion and launched the first-ever clothing line Plein Sport.
To be honest, I think, that this is the right direction for Philipp Plein
Sometimes, it seems that his clothes are really for another world
Why not for METAverse? 😉
Patchwork as the most understandable and literal vision of upcycling continues to flourish and multiply 😉 Denim, blanket jackets, deconstructive shirts - do not limit your imagination
Try to do it yourself, focusing on the references above, or look for something similar in the finished version.
Digital couture (yes, this one also exists) by  😉
For example, the Crystal wedding dress consists of a carved corset with curls of shells, a lace skirt, a parametric gradient skirt of crystals, and shining diamonds.
Or maybe you want to try on abstract Chaos, which is distorted and intertwined, turning into a beautiful outfit?
For dessert, I will offer a digital Chinese national dress and a blouse cut and polished from a piece of ore.
Rhinestone make-up gets a new take on Burberry show Fall 2022
And even if it's not for every day, it's a work of art🤍
More recently, we have seen this at
At yesterday's Grammy ceremony, all outfits can be conditionally divided into:
🤪full cringe 
⚪️ minimalism - in color and without
✨ "you need to live in splendor"
In general, everything is like in life🤷🏼‍♀️ There is a place for everyone😉
We understood the general mood of the Grammys
Now a little about exciting details:
We saw twice blown glass Coperni bag - ✌🏼 Blue with golden sweets inside - the best💙
Chanel men's tweed suit - yes, it turns out that this also exists😜
Archive dress Versace 1992 on Dua Lipa
A red leather beret on 78-year-old Joni Mitchell ❤️
Blue hair for men - a coincidence or a trend?🤔
A jacket for a naked male body (or almost naked) - already seen at the Oscars, definitely a men's fashion trend.
Cosmetics are also rushing into the METAuniverse🌐
MAC introduced their NFT lipsticks using drawings by Keith Haring -   3 types of NFT
An interesting gradation of prices by color:
🔴Red - $25,
🔵Blue - $150,
🟡Yellow - $1000.
Well, as you understand, the yellow lips of the avatar are the most prestigious👌🏼 😂
If you are one of those who expected that ugly shoes will remain in the past and this year we will all be wearing elegant heels, then I have to upset you.🤷🏼‍♀️ And please those who stand up for convenience, comfort, and indifference to anything and everything
😂 Crocs are not the ugliest thing that awaits us this coming summer, in preparation for this I propose to consider a selection from the latest shows.
Photos in sequence👇🏼
Balmain
Givenchy
DSquared2
Palm Angels
Balenciaga Crocs Pool
Stella McCartney
It is already clear that this spring and summer, tops are becoming incredibly popular, the reason for this is the influence of the 2000s, and the remnants of the aesthetic of post-pandemic convenience
In short (more to come), then here are the main TOP-3 tops😊:
Are you ready to bare your bellies?😉
And today I will tell you about another bright digital collaboration Converse x Bitmoji
A digital collection includes T-shirts, shorts, hoodies and of course the iconic Chuck Taylor All Star sneakers👟 in multiple colors.
The capsule should draw attention to Snapchat's new feature, outfit sharing
Now Snapchatters can share their Bitmoji outfits with friends and try other users' looks on their own avatar.
🤫 And for those who still prefer to dress in the real world, Converse will also be releasing physical pairs of the new Lugged 2.0 model, which are on sale today
The digital collection is already available on the Bitmoji and Snapchat apps.
Burberry Fall 2022 Menswear is a guide to hoods - on trench coats, shirts, sweatshirts..
But if hoods are a common thing, then caps without back, and trousers with a high waist make us wonder: "Is everything normal"?😂
A bit of color therapy on Sunday morning
If the weather still does not allow you to change into ballet shoes, then enjoy the color💚💛🧡❤️💙💜
Above is proof that it’s hard to find something better than colored boots in spring, and you don’t want to😉
Meet virtual model Aliona Paul
The world is becoming less and less tangible 🌐 And it remains only to be included in this process
About a year ago, I read an interview about the advantages of virtual models
I remember that they never get sick and do not have complexes and prejudices about the clothes they show (although there was a longer list).
What do you think about this?
And if you are bored with an ordinary white tank tops , and you decide to have fun with scissors✂️, then catch a couple of options:
Tutorial by Julia Fox included😂🙈
If your summer wardrobe already has a couple of white tank tops, you can safely double or triple their number
In 2022, this is one of the most relevant models.
Their difficulty lies in the fact that, due to the plunging neckline on the shoulders, they can only be worn WITHOUT underwear - relax and wear it on your naked body.
In terms of styling, there are absolutely no taboos and restrictions, from jeans and shorts to evening skirts and heels.
And today we are talking about modern Cinderella shoes
Yesterday I saw live the result of the Manolo Blahnik x Birkenstock collab😃
This is what all the well-known Manolo Blahnik boats have turned into - the result is not for the faint of heart🤪😂 But what is really impressive is the suitcase packaging🧳🤩
Do you want to try on your glass slipper?👠
A drop of love  ❤️ Alaia's heart bag is now everywhere and everywhere.
And so, I want love to triumph in the world and be not only in the form of a bag.
Fringe is not inferior to its position in ranking the most popular decor for spring-summer 2022.
We are no longer surprised because we saw her not one or two previous seasons
But this spring and summer, it will be significantly longer and primarily thin
So that we don’t have to sweep the floors😂
A unique chic of the upcoming summer is a fringe on the grid🤩
The most successful American music festival Coachella, which takes place in the state of California, was marked in 2022 by the following fashion trends:
mesh, mesh, and solid mesh;
fringe;
glitter and sequins;
"butterflies" in all manifestations;
mini and low rise;
corsets and crop tops;
transparent dresses, tops, skirts.
Dear Zara does not lag behind luxury on all fronts 😉 and stubbornly knocks on the METAuniverse.
Zara x Zepeto is a capsule from which you can buy things physically and virtually.
Last week you checked out Manolo Blahnik x Birkenstock, so today, I decided to tell you about another collab  Dior x Birkenstock that we will definitely see more than once.
At the Dior Men Fall 2022 show, I enjoyed the cutest Birkens in beige and gray
They had flowers, felt details, and buckles with outdoor elements - simply the best from Dior and Birkenstock in one bottle.
Formally, the line is for men, but I’m sure that this will stop a few people
I definitely wouldn’t pass by🤍
Paco Rabanne x Selfridges presented us with a collection of 56 NFTs, and a dozen of them are insanely exciting and deserve attention❤️‍🔥 12 archive dresses from the 1966s collection of Paco Rabanne.
You can find "vintage" (and not only) NFTs on the 
Incredibly 💜beautiful shooting of pregnant Rihanna for Vogue.
By the way, she is wearing an Alaia lace jumpsuit on the cover
Remember the other day we discussed their heart-shaped handbags that conquer the world
The brand is clearly starting a new life, remember and follow😉
We continue about the top leaders for spring-summer 2022, and the next step is a detailed discussion of CORSETS.
A corset is a must-have in 2022, and depending on your preferences, it can be vintage, modern, or sporty.
I also suggest stylizing it in different ways
The main goal is to get away from direct boudoir association
Here are some ideas:
Which option do you like more?
Incredible shoes aesthetics in the new Zara lookbook, the way they present their shoes is worthy of applause 👏🏼
In the trends of spring-summer 2022, the marine theme has been repeatedly noticed, and most of all, mermaids🧜‍♀️
And if you hardly need a real mermaid tail, then the idea of virtual scales🐟 or octopus tentacles🐙 does not look so hopeless😉
A separate art form is Leoni's outfits at Coachella 2022
It turned out extremely nice💜
Fringe, rhinestones on the face, swimwear - as the basis of the outfit, mesh, heel + platform, pigtails, STATEMENT jewelry, lace-up shoes, beads, butterflies in the ears - a short course of the upcoming summer trends👌🏼😉
Feathers have definitely earned the title of the fashion symbol of 2022
And even if you think that this is too much and does not fit into your wardrobe, I just want you to know: the best company for feathers is essential things.
Feathers with the most simple textures, such as cotton and denim
Feathers with basic colors (white, black, beige), but if feathers are bright colors, then mostly without prints
Feathers without too much competition
There are ways to incorporate feathers into your everyday wardrobe😉
Did you already try?
The Etro collection looks very funny in a digital version at MVFW
Branded paisley cucumbers are still associated with ethnicity, originality, and history and not with the virtual world.
Although, if we consider the META-universe as a new culture, then we can proclaim this show as a connection of times 😉
The trends we have here - are cut-out dresses, asymmetry, and bright colors.
Of the trends we have here - cut out dresses, asymmetry, bright colors.
There are still those who doubt the logo-madness of the world around us, then Gucci will fix it😉
Would you like to be in a Gucci room with Gucci walls, floors, and furniture, try a Gucci cake, or drive a Gucci car?
Oh, and these Gucci nails are generally crazy🤪
I'm sure many of you know that the iconic Chanel ballet shoes were designed and thought out to visually reduce the size of the legs
😉 So, the "ballet" classics are back in trend
This year there will be very, very many of them again.
It can be classic ballerinas or slingbacks with heels, and also (my favorites) - Merry Jane, but all of them are always united by a black sock🖤
Why is knitwear considered a lot of autumn and winter? 😉
We add a little more color and have a wonderful spring outfit
And before the upcoming weekend, the idea is especially relevant👌🏼 - comfortable, cozy, and just beautiful💛
Loewe is the undisputed leader in spring-summer 2022 heels.
The most desirable heels of this year in the form of soap, candles, eggs, or roses - the more I look, the more I wish🤤
The Fendace collaboration went on sale today.
If you look at the details separately, I like it: a cap with the Fendi logo, pins on the dress, the idea of a branded lining is not new, but it also looks good - in general, it’s not bad separately, but all together - for an amateur🙈 The video fully conveys the nature of the collection 😉
Several options to "play" with a regular shirt:
-carelessly straighten out from under a hoodie / sweatshirt
Do you have any favorite styling options?
Mahmood & Blanco, representing Italy last night at Eurovision, were probably the most stylish 💗
At the performance itself, Mahmoud was in a Prada FW22 suit
Blanco was in Valentino couture, and before the press, the guys appeared even brighter: Mahmoud in pink Willy Chavarria trousers, Blanco in total Valentino from the last show.
How are you? 😉
Here are some simple trench coat styling tips:
What to do with sleeves:
How to tie a belt:
This will focus on the waist
If you ever thought that it would be nice to fit all these oversized blasers, then today's style is for you👌🏼
Yes, yes, a wide blazer can be artificially fitted:
 - peplum or sword belt, but only recently we put them away in a distant closet, but this year, it seems, or rather, for sure - we returned.
Let's see how digital virtual dresses look on real people (sorry for this pun, but you can't say more precisely😉)
Beautiful work by - these mermaid dresses, glossy textures, and puffy details are worth looking at 💜
If you suddenly decide to impress everyone with your hair, I suggest taking a incredible work by  as a reference
Hollywood wave with pigtails, asymmetric tails, and braids, geometric parting, a mix of different types of braids, braids + natural flowers🌸🌼🌺🌹🌷
When the head and hair are like a picture 🖼, and the hairdresser is like an artist 👩‍🎨
Have you already heard that Rihanna's baby was born? 😊 And this is a boy 👶🏽 The name has not been revealed yet.
Congratulations to the young mother! 🎉 And in honor of this event, today we are considering the most-most pregnant outfits Rihanna in recent months.
I have a couple of favorites, do you? By the way, it was Ree who gave us the trend to bare tummies despite the duration of pregnancy🤰
The modern analog of Tamagotchi and robotic dogs is a dog🐶 in digital form
creates pets based on artificial intelligence and releases them as NFTs
It will be possible to walk with them, as you may have guessed in the METAverse.
Well, I’m telling this all to the fact that even though the direction is still in its infancy, you can already buy  for pets, only while it is somehow not very fashion🤷🏼‍♀️ There is something to strive for😉
💜Neon as a desire for brightness
👽Neon is like a drop of modern futurism
💃🏼Neon as a way to express yourself
What are neon shades for you?
By the way, neon colors whiten the skin, so it may be too much for white skin.
How beautiful denim midi, and even better maxi!
Here are some ideas:
If you are afraid of height - add heels
If you are calm on this issue - sneakers, flip flops, slipons, sandals, and mules.
Cargo pants have gone so deep and far that even such an unexpected pair as Kim Kardashian + cargo could not do without it🙈
Although, in my opinion, a much more successful trendsetter for cargo is Emily Sindlev, Bella Hadid, or Pernille Teisbaek.
What do you think?😉
Bella Hadid at the Cannes Film Festival
I can’t express the delight that most of her appearances have caused me this time - gorgeous!
🤍Versace corset dress with a cutout on the leg
🖤🤍Black and white dress with Chopard jewelry
🖤Vintage dramatic black Versace
💙Dark blue Versace with a deep neckline
And a separate reason to smile is the process of packing evening dresses into cars😂 In Cannes, such a spectacle can be seen everywhere😉
For those who are not afraid of easy (well, or even not relatively easy) negligence, I suggest the following way of styling trousers - an inverted waist
It all started with Jacquemus (although I won't say 100%, there may have been precedents before, but massively exactly from him), and then it started.
Now a contrasting (often, as if from lining fabric) deconstructive top of trousers is a hot feature of brands and influencers.
If you are not ready to buy yet but desire to try, just turn the waist on your favorite trousers, you can fix it a little, or just iron it, and you're 👌🏼done
Straight or wide trousers with a loose fit are suitable for styling.
Hairpins everywhere, hairpins in large quantities, hairpins of various types and types, hairpins in any way - this summer, we are experimenting with hairpins, and we are not afraid to overdo it 😉
A few ideas above👆🏼😉 
Glasses with colored glasses became a serious part of our lives last summer, and they are not planning to go anywhere this year.
What about colors:
💛Yellow glasses are still in the lead (from last summer 2022)
🧡Orange glasses create competition for them (orange is generally one of the most relevant in the summer of 2022)
💙 Blue and light Blue
Light positive, loving shooting for the cover of the June British Vogue from the young Peltz-Beckham couple.
All the mood in love with life!🤍
Good summer morning! Happy start of summer, everyone! ☀️
And on this occasion - feathers  🦚
Bright fluffy, contrasting or nuanced, on shirts, tops, kimonos, coats, suits, and jeans - everything will do👌🏼
It is better if they come unfastened😉 this will significantly prolong their life and the things they cling to.
Today I will tell you one more elementary way to style your hair (and yes, it works even if it is not too clean😉 and even if there is not a lot of time) - a low tail/pigtail.
There is only one rule - we "hook" the hair as low as possible at the neck, and then - whoever is in what much:
-leave fluffy and add some waves
Inspiration attached👆🏼
Digital Couture - Dolce & Gabbana NFT Genesis Collection
Exclusively 16,000 hours handmade 
The collection is presented digitally and physically and inspired by the Venetian culture.
The first eco-activist among brands is Stella McCartney, in her case, these are not empty words
Grape cake, eco-leather from the root structure of mushrooms, and many more eco-materials are in the Resort 2023 collection.
Particular attention (as always) in the collection is paid to:
The lookbook was filmed on an Italian farm❤️
One of the most seductive tops for the summer is a suit vest
You can borrow it from the three-piece suit or just buy it separately.
We use it as a top on a naked body - with trousers, jeans, bermuda shorts, it can be either in the color of the bottom or in a contrasting color.
Depending on the silhouette you choose, the effect will be very different
Fitted (by the way, this is one of the few details of our wardrobe that is still fitted 😉) and shortened - more femininity and sexuality, while oversized and elongated - more relaxed and casual.
There are sisters Hadid as the perfect couple for the Fall 2022 Valentino collection PR, although fuchsia pink no longer needs PR 💗😂
A few favorite exits from the show from which the fuchsia boom went viral are attached
In fuchsia💗 masculine suits, capes and coats, cargo, men's total-pink variations, and curly cutouts look unrealistically cool
Black🖤 is good with cutouts and slits, transparency, gloves, and bare shoulders.
Girly ballerinas become even more infantile with straps, chains, and ankle laces.
I really like the wide understanding of Merry Jane, especially with chains and pearl laces, as in the Simone Rocha show, and if also with knee socks, then generally love🤍
So far, the craziest digital collection I have seen (although many of you will say that they are all like that 😂) is AVAVAV.
Their NFTs could be bought after the first digital fashion week of Eternal 22.
If, suddenly, you just need inspiration for crazy makeup, then look for it on Coachella❤️
Colored arrows, rhinestones, sequins, infantile flowers, bright colors - it's the best thing for the coming summer☀️
Today I will tell you about the TOP-5 skirts of summer 2022:
Mini and even micro, for total trendiness in low rise and pleated
Denim and cotton midi and maxi
With slits and cutouts, asymmetrical
Shiny and shining
Zara is not the only one that masters digital fashion from the mass market
Stradivarius also has the first Blueming digital collection - nine options costing 2-6 euros.
Available only through the application, here is the instruction for those who wish:

Let's try?
On a sultry day off, the queue to the Italian Gelateria for Italian ice cream looks exactly like in the Jacquemus commercial - everyone is there😂 And everyone has one dream - 🍦
Right now, I’m standing and melting
I hope summer has reached you too😘 Have a wonderful Sunday, everyone!
And let's take a break🧘 from the boom of color, brightness, and brilliance that came to us along with the 2000s.
I am sure that among you, despite everything, there are adherents of calm monochrome - and today, total beige is a charming palette that gives peace and warmth
And in beige monochrome (as well as, in principle, in any other monochrome), contrasting textures are good - fluffy with smooth, shiny with matte, shaggy with leather, etc.
Well, if not total, then beige is beautiful with white and black, green (but not acidic😉), brown, and red
I also really like the non-trivial combination of beige with blue and with an animal print, for example with a cow🐄 or a tiger 🐯
Today, a new collection of Skims Romance goes on sale
In honor of this, we admire Kim in transparent ruffles and flounces 😉😊
A unique chic of summer is a beach bag in the city
I beg you🙏🏼, do not deny it😉 It can be a straw bag, a huge-tote, a basket, or a mesh.
These beach guests look great with jeans, any linen and natural materials, classic trousers and suits, and even joggers
The most dangerous option - with breezy summer sundresses - may turn out to be too beachy🤷🏼‍♀️ and out of place.
Gemes and rhinestones got to Swarovski sunglasses, of course, not an option for every day, but on the other hand, why not? 😊
By the way, the line of new Swarovski jewelry itself causes me extremely positive emotions and a desire to attach a couple of bracelets and necklaces to my arms and neck
The rings are also a success💙
Good Saturday morning with an excellent example of how a basket can become the perfect handbag❤️
Read more about beach and wicker bags in the city 
And we are returning to the skirts, as promised
We will discuss, look at, and style each 
 And today - transparent skirts and mesh skirts are a hot hit.
At first glance, the trend is difficult to apply in real life, but it gets along well with the bottom layer:
Well, if you have the courage😉:
-with a bodysuit,
Another opportunity to slightly reduce the degree of transparency is an elongated shoulder product - a masculine jacket, a long shirt, or even an oversized hoodie/sweatshirt.
An interesting 👌🏼 stylization is obtained with contrast knee-highs/stockings under a transparent skirt.
And I can give similar advices about transparent dresses, which are in no way inferior to mesh skirts in their popularity.
And today we are talking about straight midi or maxi skirts
And here I will talk about fairly dense textures that hold their shape
First of all, of course, denim 💙, as an alternative there are cotton or thick linen
For these skirts, the trend of slits on one leg is relevant (this makes them more comfortable when walking), but in general this is not necessary.
The straight skirt creates the silhouette of a column, as we continue to visualize how to style this skirt - we have an extension on the top and bottom of the column, as well as for this skirt.
With straight midi and maxi skirts, any massive shoes and a loose top look great, but you can limit yourself to one of these elements, for example, by choosing a massive platform and complementing the skirt with a tight-fitting long-sleeve, or vice versa, neat flat shoes and an asymmetric skirt tucked into oversized shirt
Collars on dresses are an inexhaustible topic that we have been enjoying for more than a year
Infantilism, rusticism, girly motifs, or the image of a fatal "teacher" depends on the collar type and its character.
Lace, crochet, ruffled, millefleur print, rounded or edgy..
yes, basically anything
I suggest you enjoy it.
How languidly hot 🔥 look knitted dresses in maxi length in summer performance: crochet, macramé, openwork inclusions, and revelry in colors - from neutral to bright and flashy colors.
If you haven't tried it yet, I recommend checking it out
From personal experience - although dresses seem to be transparent, they often weigh half a pood😂 Although it all depends on the technique, a banal physical fitting will help to understand the real weight👌🏼
A hat for the summer is my personal must-have (and in the cold seasons, I rarely wear them myself, although it looks lovely visually), so today we are talking about hat favorites for the summer of 2022:
The trend for "naked clothes" is only gaining momentum every season
If it all started with harmless (at least as it seems to us now) translucent materials, now not just transparent things are in favor, but a complete imitation of a naked body.
Well, as an absolute embodiment of the Lotta Volkova x Jean Paul Gaultier collection.
Today we look at casual kimonos 👘 and some styling tips:
And the perfect unmistakable pair "for every day" - kimono 👘 + jeans 👖
Are you experimenting with these silhouettes?
Pajama shorts, boxer shorts - call it what you want
The main thing is that this is the perfect option for the summer of 2022🤩
In general, a precious little thing for a hot summer😊
Anna Dello Russo is the Italian queen of catsuits who is not afraid to look ridiculous 😊 Always on the verge of urban troubles, but, obviously, for this, she is loved in Italy and all over the world so much 💛
It is an excellent mood for Friday night💃🏼 Have a great weekend, everyone!!!
Whenever in the summer! ☀️ Jeans with the lowest possible fit and flat stomachs are treacherously flashing this summer from all sides 😂 If so, why not? 😉
If you have already decided, do not cover the waist area - we wear it with crop tops, bralettes,  shortened T-shirts, and everything above the navel👌🏼 There is also a recommendation for models - do not choose tight fitting
Wide and straight models will look modern but NOT skinny.
Rings on the toes, of course, are not new and, frankly, not the most convenient accessory, but they convey the atmosphere of summer and relaxation perfectly
At Etro Spring 2023 Menswear, rings were used with pajama sets, linen shorts and trousers, classic blue denim, and even a summery white suit.
Although the show was for men, the idea is agender, so let's try!

What a short-sleeved shirt looks like in summer 2022:
The easiest way is to borrow a men's one, the sleeve will most likely be elbow-deep, and the silhouette is just right😉
The atmosphere of summer Paris 💗 and a portion of style from the French blogger Ambre Deveaux 😘
Have you tried the game of bocce in the last video, beloved by Italians and French?
See-through tops and dresses are a continuation of a naked theme we have been walking around for the second or third year
A common feature is a transparency and fitting - as a result, it turns out to be on the verge of frankness
Therefore we “land” with denim, heavy or sports shoes, and oversized silhouettes.
And you can wear it on bralettes, bandeau tops, or even on a naked body (for the city, I still recommend it, subject to the presence of an upper covering layer, although ...
frank alternatives are also possible😉)
Jeans are getting wider, longer and bulkier
Will be nice to add holes, fringes, a dropped fly and a low waist - in general, size matters, and the larger it is, the better this year.
In order to balance the character a little, you can staling it with heels, a tight top, a corset, a silk shirt - the play of opposites is always welcome👌🏼
Loafers with socks and golfs - the aesthetics of beautiful university times🖤
The most uncomplicated and most understandable stylization is with a miniskirt
Playing with contrasts - with a long oversized jacket or a feminine dress
Softer quote - with a knitted dress
The lightest option - with cropped jeans
By the way, I met the point of view that "loafers should not be mixed with thick socks" I disagree and protest; socks can be any, including woolen - the only question is how much the size and width of the loafers allow😉
We haven't talked about the META space for a long time😊 Did you know that Paris Hilton is one of the most active "inhabitants" of the META universe?
Paris World is a virtual island 🏝 where you can ride a trendy sports car or a yacht and also see a digital copy of Paris' house in Beverly Hills
The star has already organized fashion shows in the same place - .
Well, Paris Hilton plans to create her own digital brand.
Fashion week in Copenhagen is already in full swing, and we are happy to look at Danish street style🤎
My favorite pastime is looking at fashionistas on bicycles, two extra wheels give them some special chic 🚲
By the way, Copenhagen clearly showed and proved the relevance of Balenciaga's futuristic "fly" sunglasses, to be honest, I haven't tried them on yet, but the desire has appeared🕶
The latest cargo-pants styling from street style in Copenhagen 🤍
Oh, cargo, why do I love you so much? 💔
Another confirmation that denim shoes are back in earnest is Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's new collaboration with GIABORGHINI
Denim, rhinestones, and heels 💙 I liked the mules especially 👍🏼 I understand that only for dry weather, but suddenly, you have just such a 😉
A simple life hack on how to make yourself denim leggings/boots a la Coperni, scissors in hand✂️ and around cabinets😂
A minute of beauty on the channel,  today we talk about manicures and a new trend - glazed manicure
The trend is gaining momentum; in social networks, we are looking for the tag 😉
A pearly, shimmery manicure like icing on your favorite cake🎂 or moonlight🌛 on a beautiful night sky.
The leading trendsetter of this beauty is Hailey Bieber
Still, many have already pulled themselves up, so I suggest we keep up 😉 A brief instruction is also on the network
I am attaching it 😉
Who has butterflies in their stomach? 🦋😉 Release! This summer, and next fall, you can definitely👌🏼
We are not limited to flowers, we add butterflies in all dimensions - tops, jewelry, bags, belts, shoes, and when autumn comes, it will come to jackets.
Catch it while the season and treat with care😉
It's already September, and you haven't walked up in your favorite sandals or sandals? Do not rush to put them away until next summer
Better get your socks🧦
The perfect time for the already recognized trend of open shoes + socks:
With sandals, heels, and even classic pumps❤️
Holes, scuffs, uneven denim edge - do not deny yourself anything except to combine 🙅🏻‍♀️ it all with a skinny silhouette
If you prefer grungy, then do it on any free jeans model.
Another little detail from the 2000s that I'm sure many of us remember is the zigzag parting
Let's draw and slick, just like Bella😉
And for many, the weather seems to hint and insist on outerwear
🤷🏼‍♀️😊 We are discussing the bomber jacket as the discoverer of our autumn.
2 ways of modern styling:
Masculine style - with straight, almost masculine trousers, wide jeans, cargo, loafers and brogues, classic sneakers, shirts, basic t-shirts
Contrasting style - with mini or maxi skirts, dresses, lightweight materials, heels, and revealing cutouts
Heading to NY for fashion week? 😉
Beautiful Carolina Herrera Spring 2023 with its already signature stripe 🖤 paired with a millefleur.
Large textile flowers were added to the tiny floral print, gorgeous flowered textile boots and sandals, clear reception of accent printed accessories - a clutch or a belt, a mix of flowers of different colors
And, according to tradition, many flying fabrics, ruffles, voluminous sleeves - in general, everything we expect from the spring collection.

How does minimalism merge with bright details, and what comes out?
As usual, one of the most wearable and easy to use in our everyday non-catwalk life COS with its Fall 2022 collection
Getting ready for the cold weather and see what will make our life more fun😉
Bright and flashy accessories - bags, scarves, hats
Animal print on outerwear and knitwear
Colored skin
Socks and stockings
Bright shirt fronts and balaclavas
Bright bottom layer in a layering
In the meantime, Milan is taking over the baton of Fashion week, in which I am also going to participate and share with you
We review and study London street style.
Lots of ruffles and frills, puffed sleeves and huge collars, brocade and tulle combined with a bit of English stiffness, plaid, lots of Mary Jane variations, golfs, leather, and punk casualness 🎸 🤘🏼
Fendi delighted everyone who bought green clothes last year and continued this grassy extravaganza in the Spring 2023 collection.
Handbags, slippers, boots, and even total-green 💚 Delicate pistachio and fresh mint were a plus to the herbal one
Honestly, it reminds me a little of the best times at Bottega
There are fluffy mules, a lot of knitwear, elongated sleeves, and shaggy textures
And from the special, I liked the delicate asymmetry and side slits on the sleeves and skirts.
I went to Etro Spring 2023 street style for paints, prints, and textures, sharing the mood I caught there and photos made by my own hands 🤲🏼
I’ll start with the atmosphere, the show, and as a result, the street style took place in the industrial zone of Milan and was accompanied by a roar, howl, and signals of disgruntled trucks 🚚 🚛 , traffic that was not blocked, but photographers and street stylers scurrying everywhere and everywhere, significantly complicated it 🔴
And then everything is as expected - notes of ethnicity in the form of jersey with fringes, small and complex prints, bright saturated colors, patchwork, some leather, but more suede.
I have loved Etro for many years and have chosen the perfect accents for my wardrobe there! ❤️🤎
And I have for you a new batch of fresh street shot by myself before the Elisabetta Franchi Spring 2023 show.
Minis, catsuits, heels, over the knee boots, hats, maxi flowers, slits and sexy in the truest sense of the Italians.
Acne Studios Spring 2023 on how to wear:
And use the bag as a means of self-defense 😉
Let's return today to the green💚 topic, which has not gone far from us, but on the contrary, has become even more comprehensive
And if earlier in total green we could look like a blade of grass in a May field, now everything is much more diverse.
Mix different shades of green - here is the color of fresh grass, mint candy, rich olive, and crispy pistachio
In general, there is where to roam
Get everything that is green and try to combine 👌🏼
☕️It's cloudy and rainy outside the window☔️
The mood is to wrap yourself in a knitted dress and enjoy your favorite cappuccio - what could be better for a Wednesday morning?
Favorite🏆 styles:
Knitted dress with sneakers
Knitted dress with trumpet/jockey boots that overlap with the dress.
Knitted dress overskirt
Knitted dress with rough, worn leather
How happy I am when the roads of trends and conveniences coincide❤️ Aesthetics here also passed very close, at least in my opinion, although aesthetics, of course, are more subjective😉
One of the most joyful fall 2022 shoe trends I've met is colorful sneakers 🔴🟠🟡🟢🔵🟣 Bright, contrasting, a little crazy 🤪
And most importantly, don't limit yourself to styling them only in sports and casual
Colored sneakers will ideally relax a classic trouser suit
Аnd mix very well with a dress or a mini skirt (you can soften the transition from sneakers to the leg with white socks)
Аnd ideally, complement the trendy midi or maxi skirt this fall.
As an illustrative example, I have collected the outfits of the local Italian star Chiara Ferragni, a well-known lover of bright sneakers
She even has a line of such under her own brand.
A bit of street style from Paris Fashion Week Spring 2023:
Hoodie + Coat - Yes or No?
As for me, there is nothing better and more convenient than such a couple for daily routine worries that have to be done more often than bright events happen😉🤷🏼‍♀️
While it is still not too cold, the coat can be left open
The hoodie can be worn without an underlayer
However, it is also not forbidden to pry off the turtleneck to save the throat and tighten the belt on the coat.
Let's look at the beauty celebration from Prada about the new fragrance PARADOXE
Here we have everything in style:
conciseness in color and silhouettes;
oversized jackets
a drop (or not a drop) of glitter and a few feathers
leather
crossbody with very short straps
And triangles, triangles, triangles😊
